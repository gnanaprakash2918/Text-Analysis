3,Awesome üòé
4,"Not related to Ramaswamy as I don't know much about US politics, but the Indian diaspora I've met in Canada exhibits with the same ""burn the bridge when you cross it"" mentality. The only people here who have ever been hateful towards me are second generation Indians."

6,"‚ÄúAnd replace it with meritocratic admission‚Äù.
Let‚Äôs stop falling for these clickbait titles.

The H1B is a numbers game and is a lottery - making it ripe for gaming/cheating the system. And Indian consultancy companies definitely cheat the system:
- Set the pay at the minimum set for H1B (still below the industry average).
- Create multiple applications with slight different job titles
- Apply for 10 people when the requirement is only for 2-3, thus by the number game they‚Äôll get 2-3 at least.

Real talent (top universities), achievements (patents, research work, etc), and remuneration (high pay, equity, etc) are all not considered. It‚Äôs simply a lottery, which is entirely skewed towards large low-pay hirers (which is bad in the long term)."
7,"what's with indians joining republican party instead of democratic ? how does the interests of a racial minority better align with conservatives ? and yeah, i have same doubt about rishi sunak."
8,"Click bait title, reading the article he wants to end lottery system but that will basically mean only the top tier people will get h1b?"
9,"Hardly a surprise, the guy's a huge hypocrite"
10,Republican
11,"The H1B program IS really shitty. It's used to hire cheap labor from overseas, thus reducing opportunities for citizens. The worst part is, it creates a trap for the new immigrants because they rely on the employer to stay in the country...meaning they may have to put up with unfair wages. The alternative is hiring an expensive lawyer and somehow navigating the US legal system.

The immigration system is so broken that it is incredibly hard to get a PR(greencard), and we have many cases where children of immigrants on H1B age out of their parents sponsorship and become Dreamers or have to return to their ""native"" country even if they've lived in the US their entire lives. It is a form of indentured servitude that is a result of greedy corporations willing to screw desperate foreigners and unwilling to put up with the rights and expectations of actual citizens. 

It needs to go. The entire US immigration system needs to be flushed out and made efficient."
12,"Please vote for this man, to let other countries retain their high tech talent and prevent brain drain"
13,"This comment section is so misinformed. I‚Äôve used H1B in the past. It‚Äôs a brutal lottery system that‚Äôs a headache for everyone involved - employee, employer, employees family everyone. If there‚Äôs something of a merit based system that guarantees employment it‚Äôll remove the element of chance and be better for everyone. 
NO ONE likes the lottery system . Ask any prospective student why they‚Äôd want to move to Canada. It‚Äôs because it gives them more of a stable idea of their future.
Coming to the point that he used it 29 times. Guess what geniuses, if you want to hire some foreign talent immediately THERE IS NO option other than H1B. A lot of companies just don‚Äôt hire Indians coz h1b Lagana padtha hai.
Headline likhne waala tu chuthya hai hi saath me comments me log misinform ho rahe hain. George bush ne Jo maari thi system ki Abhi bi lagi hui hai. 
Abhi wo theek karega ki nahin I don‚Äôt know. But if there‚Äôs something better than h1b system there‚Äôll be nobody happier than the Indian immigrants"
14,DOnt take him seriously. He panders a lot to trump supporters so that he can become Trump's replacement if he goes to jail or become Trump's VP candidate.
15,Coconut
16,Comments prove nobody reads the article but just falls for the ragebait headline.
17,Lol good luck!
18,Asshole is pulling up the ladder behind him .. this seems to be a popular opinion among most Indian American's & NRIs who have made it ..
19,"Is it weird that I agree with him? Immigration based on meritocracy ain't bad. In fact, it's beneficial for our students who are getting screwed by the unjust H1B lottery and consultancy interference."
20,Incomplete headline. He wants to end the lottery based system and bring in a meritocratic system.
21,"Indians are historically famous for fucking up their own race .


When the Britisher's ruling india there were less than 10000 of them present here, the rest are Indians supporting the entire system of exploitation of their countrymen. 

I hope some of these modern ""wannabewhitemen "" do the same as Chinese expats returning there love to their country."
22,"The article sounds like a clickbait. He's not proposing *sropping* indian immigration, but replacing the current system which is flawed. Relying on a lottery for immigration is absurd (although granted it would be hard to approve and reject millions of applicants per year on the basis of merit), and locks people into employers which can lead to toxic work culture and exploitation. 


The article is trying to make it sound like he's stopping Indians from immigrating entirely, which is false. I'm not informed enough about this guy and his platform to have any meaningful opinion on it"
23,"If only people stopped coming on H1B and stayed back .. like everyone ... would love to see the face of all these idiots who trash talk and treat all Indians like shit .. and have their whole economy go back 20 years. 

Motherfuckers just have money. And we are making it for them."
24,"This article is complete BS. He did not use H1B visa scheme. His company used it to hire foreign employees (he himself was born in US).

He is also not saying don‚Äôt hire foreign workers. He is saying the current lottery based visa system is very shitty and there should be some merit based system. To my mind he seems to be making some case for a points based system like you see in Canada or Australia."
25,"Another example of Indian in foreign land screwing fellow Indians.   


I've been in Ireland for over a year now, people I know who have been here for longer have echoed the same - its always the Indians fucking over other Indians - mostly for no good reason."
26,This dude is the perfect embodiment of the cognitive dissonance in the GOP lol. if he thinks he has a shot in the primaries let alone the presidential elections with his obvious pandering to the MAGA and the Q-Anon contingent of the GOP. The fact that he isn't white is enough for the average GOP voter to not even consider him as serious candidate even if his policy positions are better then Trump
27,Indians in America act like cunts. Idk if they are actually cunts but they do act well.
28,I understand how this proposed plan is bad for Indians. but why did he use an H1B visa for 29 times when he was born in Ohio and he is an American citizen by birth.
29,"People don‚Äôt understand, he‚Äôs an American citizen and since he‚Äôs running for president, he will support America and it should be that way, support the country of your citizenship."
30,[deleted]
31,"Vivek Ramaswamy is a Palakkad Tambrahm, who are some of the biggest Sanghi-Nazis in this country.

Absolutely no surprise that he has become a Republican. If he were still in India, he would have joined the BJ Party."
32,What an as*hole
33,"If only this were his ""worst"" policy, this idiot was Americans to write a test to be eligible to vote, and doesn't believe in climate change amongst other things"
34,"Personally, I hate immigrants and immigration."
35,He doesn't want any more Dalits to make their way to the USA as USA will become impure due to their presence ?
36,"To be honest when I finally reached USA I was very happy that I‚Äôm away from nosy and judgemental Indian community. I was shattered to see lots of Indian diaspora in USA. 

We run away to escape the swamp and we have to put up with it America also. I get him.

To be honest after I saw mini india in Chicago and NY area my interest in USA has decreased"
37,If Chatur settled in US
38,"I am happy some one is trying to ban H1 B.Prioritize people who have atleast Ph.d's from USA college. Masters /MTECH in CS in USA is so easy - Not that much  research involved for people .

Some of my friends took 4\* CS Course - 2 MBA  courses -  2 STAT courses .

Meanwhile people with Ph.D for Non-CS - are made to get low pay and work as research associate. 

This H1b visas are exploited by Indian consultancy's with fake experiences also. 

Lottery system giving is random and difficult to predict - what about people who have spent atleast 5 years doing Ph.D .

Underserving canditate getting job  utilizing h1B by faking interview is really bad.Few Indian companies have known to crack it. 

In fact ,H1b should be offered by performance  while in  university,work researchwhile  in college /internships - Finally Please prefer for Ivy league colleges graduates."
39,"Without H1B  visa , usa is  just country of drug addiction üòë"
40,Typical Brahmin
41,And Uday wants to end sanatan. So?
42,Get the f outta here
43,"Not an American, can someone help understand how he‚Äôs running for presidency if he‚Äôs used H1B before? Doesn‚Äôt the candidate need to be a natural born U.S citizen?"
44,"Need, Requiremnt and circumstances change"
45,"Bhai vote chiye usko 
Logo ki chaatni toh padegi"
46,"This guy is toast even if he doesn't realize it. To his party's voters he looks just like Kal Penn, Aziz Ansari and even Mindy Kaling. So all it'll take to kill his campaign is one joke from any of them about Trump. Big Cheeto himself will call him some racist nickname and end this guy's entire political career.

""[Da Vek](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/26/vivek-ramaswamy-eminem-rap-00108137)"" is destined to be ""Da Who?"""
47,"There are numerous Indians in US too have same mentality. I have seen them calling newly arrived people as ""You Indians"" and ""your festival""."
48,This clown will not even get past the gop primary stage. just keeps spewing nonsense every now and then. best ignored.
49,I think what he is talking about is the fact that employers misuse the H1B visa to force employees to accept lower wages and other kinds of compromises. The system is gamed towards employer benefit and not for the employees. Not sure what he is proposing in its place but a system which empowers the foreign worker to demand better pay and working conditions should be supported.
50,"Misleading headline. He is a US-born citizen. He used the program to recruit people for his company, as there is no other options to do so currently. Him wanting it to be a merit based system has nothing hypocritical you want to be outraged by, it might even help Indians."
51,H1B visa will trigger the collapse of American economy.
52,"He is trying so hard to be ""American"" it's really becoming awkward now."
53,What a utter click bait headline. OP get some rest
54,Doland Tromp will beat him
55,Fucking coconut ü••
56,"> Calling the H-1B visa programme ""indentured servitude"", Indian-American Republican presidential aspirant Vivek Ramaswamy has vowed to ""gut"" the lottery-based system and replace it with meritocratic admission if he wins the race to the White House in 2024.

Very clickbaity headline imo."
57,This guy is a shame to the Indian diaspora
58,"It‚Äôs ending anyway, even without his intervention. Many IT companies have more or less shut down on-site travel. He is just trying to accelerate the inevitable. Canada and UK are still good options."
59,"Ladder kicker. Typical attitude, see cruella braverman, kemi badenough, richi sunak, pritler patel."
60,Same thing with Suella Braverman in UK. Just kick off the ladder once you have climbed up.
61,"This is privilege speaking. ‚ÄúMy parents came here with no money‚Äù. Bullshit. Only Indians who manage to come to the US are the ones who have resources back home. Even today, you need funds to come. The fact that he founded multi million dollar companies is due to the privilege he had. Stable family, resources , good education. He cannot compare his immigration journey with undocumented immigrants who flee actual poverty and violence and still make something of themselves"
62,Ah the typical burn the bridge once you‚Äôve crossed it mentality!
63,"This is just a reflection of the caste mentality in us. The graded ladder where everyone has someone to look down upon. These people who escaped from India now look down upon us as losers.

And we are planning to give NRIs voting rights. 

How can a country as a culture celebrate the fact that you escaped it and award these fktards? Whatever remittances they give, is used to fuel up and create a real estate bubble. Is there any gainful money coming?"
64,"1. This comment section is SUPER misinformed about H1B.
2. Misinformation campaign against him, just like any other politician. Don‚Äôt fall for it."
65,Dude has absolutely no chance to get elected. He‚Äôs just another race-hating Republicunt
66,"(There is heavy misinformation campaign against him by others. Don‚Äôt be that gullible idiot, do you research.

If you have any questions ask me. I have heard hundreds of hours of his podcasts with different hosts, and read his books. I can answer questions.)

Summary response: Obviously H1B is a twisted system, much cleaner implementations are possible. H1B Lottery is being gamed by people, 7-8 petitions being put it to increase the odds. Most of it are bogus petitions. Genuine companies and people are missing out because of it. It needs to be torn down. Also job mobility is VERY poor."

68,"Hey bro, happy birthday!
The pizza is on me
Give me your upi"
69,Thank you for sharing your story here. You ve come so far already and achieved all on your own merit by turning your life around. I know it sucks and might suck more for a little while but you are truly destined for success. You've inspired me to work harder.
70,Brother it is very stresssful for your father to manage the family with that amount of monthly salary. SO because of this stress I guess he has lectured you one thing you can do is try to find an internship for your expenses.
71,"Bro if you're in IITK then let me know, I'm a 3rd yr ug here, me and my friends will be more than happy to organise a nice birthday party for our junior ‚úåÔ∏è, you won't escape the GPL thoüòÅ"
72,"If you are from IIT kharagpur, contact me out. I am a fourth year undergrad here. Would be glad to celebrate the birthday of a junior üòÉ"
73,Hey buddy. Happy belated birthday. I'll happily get you some pizza and more if you're okay with that. Consider it a birthday celebration from a friend. Just let me know when and we can make it happen ü§ó
74,I don't understand why people here are so critical . Everyone at some point in time have asked their parents for something that their parents can't afford.
75,"What a guy OP is, refusing to take money from anyone. Massive respect to you man, wish you the best for everything you do!! Happy birthday!!  It's just a few more years of struggle man good luck"
76,"Rookie mistake , if you didn't mention the pizza you may have even gotten the money and definitely wouldn't have gotten a lecture"
77,Hey OP your day will come. Don‚Äôt let these things get you. Despite what the other comments are saying I understand how it might feel to always be getting treats and not being able to give one. You can plan ahead next time and earn some pocket money as you seem smart enough to do so. Happy birthday!!
78,"Hey OP, if you have paypal then i can send you 500 rs for pizza. Happy Birthday :) 

Ignore all the negative nancies in the comment section who are trying to pull you down on your freaking bday. I am guessing you are very young, probably still a teenager. All of us can sit on our high horse and give gyaan but i can understand how does it feels to not have soemthing that you see everyone else have. You are young and a human, these emotions are normal. May be when you are older and more mature, you will see your father's POV but it's okay, even if you don't. 

Don't worry, you are in a great college and just in few years you will have a great life. Keep your head high and keep working hard."
79,Happy to pitch in for some soft drinks. No pizza party is complete without some beverages. You can DM me your UPI ID :)
80,"Happy Birthday, OP! pls ignore all the negative comments. what you felt is absolutely right, although your dad's action was misplaced but tryna understand from his perspective. It's okay, try for some internships? And use that 150 rupees for a small pizza maybe? 
Please don't get disheartened and use your opportunity in a meaningful way! I hope your dreams come true in the long run :')))"
81,"Happy Birthday bhai..
UPI bata abhi party krenge apan."
82,"I can understand your feeling. My family lost everything after 2008 recesssion and it made my mother just like your father. Even when i was earning 100k a month from tutions, she wouldnt let me spend more tha 1000 rupees on something she didnt see as necessary. It also made me feel you are right now at times.

But, now that I am married and have to take care of my expenses and everything on my own. I finally understood her. She wanted to save for me. The same mother spend lavishly on my wedding. 

One day, you will too understand what your father is going through.

Also, Wish you a very happy birthday."
83,"Ignore the rest, most have never faced problem like you and are just being judgemental. I know it's hard but try to find atleast 2 hours a day to earn from tuition. Even if it's just one student, teach them science and maths to earn decent money for your own personal expenses.


Parents are there to lecture only, they don't understand the pressure you are facing to pull your family out of poverty. When you do so even then people will just praise your parent for the sacrifices they did but no one will understand the pressure you go through. Your mental heath is important.


Happy birthday in advance."
84,"I feel you dude. You've the right to feel frustrated. You've worked so hard to get here and still are in a financial crunch. It can feel really awful to see other people spending your entire month's stipend in a single sitting, and being scolded for asking for what you deem to be a meager amount after looking at other people.

But please try to understand your father's situation also. As per your post, your family has 5-6k spending money left each month, out of which your father's sending you 1K already. He's sending you nearly a fifth of what he has left over.

Plus I am sure there are other expenses associated with your education too like travel, gadgets, etc. College expenses are difficult for even middle class people too. I am sure it is excruciating for someone who's already in a financial crunch. Your family must be making huge sacrifices for you to study for 4 years.

I am not trying to downplay your pain, but you have to be strong. You've three full years of college left before you'll be able to get a job. The road to your destination will be painful, but till then you've got to be really strong. I can suggest a few ways to help alleviate your problems though:

Be hypervigilant of online scams. Easy ways to make money, cryptocurrency, stocks, get rich quick schemes all will make you poorer.

Save any windfalls/excess money you have for a rainy day

Weekends are typically easy at IITs (at least it was quite chill for me). Get a part time remote internship/job to supplement your stipend.

Aim for a good paying internship during your summer breaks (winter breaks are small, but there are some remote internships you can do to make some quick bucks)

If the situation is too dire, maybe Upwork etc. but there are a lot of scummy people out there so I would not do those unless nothing else works."
85,"Hey buddy, Happy Birthday. I know how it feels. I have overcome some dire situations and is doing better now. I would love to give you and your friend a pizza party, DM me."
86,"Ignore idiots here who have leeched off their parents, never cracked a top 100 college but act like bhishm pitama. Send your upi instead"
87,"My father didn't even wish me on my birthday (which was just a few days ago), I asked my mother to hand him the phone so that I could talk to him and he barely said happy birthday and cut the call. It happens bro, become soulless, that's the only way to survive in this world with your sanity intact."
88,"It feels like that life is unfair but it will be better once you graduate. Also, there are websites like chegg where you can earn money via tutoring. I used to do the same in college and didn‚Äôt need any financial support from my parents."
89,"Unless you have tasted deficiency, you never realise the beauty of opulence.Back in DU days, friendgroup wore metal t shirts, while I wore buttoned up checked shirts. Priced at 700 INR, saved for 10 months, went to showroom, it was not there, not even in sale. saved 900 for a guitar, got pickpocketes in DTC. Did not eat pizza for whole 3 years, never ventured inside any Fast food chain. Got humiliated at a subway. Wore shoes from sreeleather priced at 150/200 while eyeing those Nike Adidas Puma. Wore a roommate's Lee jeans and realised, how soft and fitting it feels, then asked him the price, and dropped the idea then and there. All 3 years, checked which place offered cheapest Atta roti, had to discern between 2 a piece, and 1 a piece. Learnt cooking.So I get the jist bro..affording auto was luxury.

Took tuitions to make end meet.Dude you are in IIT, ber Sarai is nearby, in case you are in Delhi, even otherwise, just swing some networks. Lot of work. Checking papers for JEE NEET aspirants. Preparing question papers. Coachings prefer students who have cleared competitive exams. Chegg. I mean otherwise for home tuitions  too people spend a lot on their kids, chargeable by hours.

Eventually you will reach a point post all this where you get bored by stays in Hilton and Hyatts and alike..All the best! Study well do well!

See life has always been unfair. And too very much extremes.This phase makes you receptive to life, it's inadequacies, and you develops empathy for all those struggling and making ends meet.  We all have different levels of privilege, small or big. The sad but best part is it makes you wise a bit early, though at the cost of childhood and adolescence. But embrace it, IIT mein ho Saraswati ka vardaan hai, that's your privilege. Usi mein Khushi dhoondni padegi."
90,you‚Äôre gonna be filthy rich soon just hang on
91,"Read this Post after 5 years from now and you will be greatful to the almighty for the successful life you have.

May this 500 Rs you will be earning per minute of  your life.

I wish and pray that you be taxed the highest tax bracket of the  income tax.(for sure you will earn that much )

Life moves on ... Bless you my Brother üôè"
92,"It might make sense to you later on, I have been in a similar situation. During my engineering my families financial condition wasn‚Äôt too good. Not gonna say that we were too poor, but simply things were not working out financially for a few years. 

My friends had planned for a day trip which would cost us like rs 300 each. Asked my parents for the same but my mom said we don‚Äôt have the money at the moment ( maybe we were done for the budget that month or something else was the reason never really asked) but it kinda felt weird cuz it was just 300 and impacted me in a weird way. After that every time my friends planned a trip I just tried to dodge it. That incident happened like 5 years ago, never been on a trip since then. Something just stuck in my mind and since then two things happened 1. I made sure I am not gonna struggle with money and be in a similar situation ever 2. I could not get myself to go on a trip since then, right now I am working and can do a trip but somehow am blocked mentally and I just can‚Äôt get myself to go onto a trip. 


Sometimes little things impact on people‚Äôs mind. Maybe you will have clarity on this after a few years.

Edit: for now don‚Äôt think too much on this, try to understand your families point of view."
93,Off topic but really commendable you got into a good college. And what‚Äôs more commendable is once you get a job you‚Äôre actually gonna pull your whole family out of poverty. Just goes to show education is such a powerful tool which can really turn things around for you no matter where you come from. Keep going and all the very best for your future. May you achieve everything you hoped for.
94,Bhai send your upi.
95,Hope to hear your first salary update soon!!
96,"Hi, OP i dont think your father is trying to make you feel bad. It might just be the way things are right now. I hope you reach great heights and are able to make quite the living for yourself and your family."
97,Cake and sweets are on me for you and your family. Birthday ke din muh meetha karna bohot jaruri hai.
98,"Everyone is pooling in for bros bday party..

Stuff like this is what makes a day amazing"
99,"Hey dude. Take it from someone who is a father and at least twice the age you are, it would have hurt hurt hurt your father to say no to you. I can say so just based on the fact that he gave you a 30 mins 'lecture'. The lecture might have been as much to convince you as much as to explain to himself.

Please try to see things from his perspective, like others have already said. Call him on your birthday and ask for his blessings. That will make his and your day.

Plus the way I see it, your parents have put you on the path to success, in whatever means and ways. That's what anyone can really do for their kids. How you leverage that is up to you. But don't also unnecessarily pressure yourself. These days won't come back.

You're in a top tier college with world class amenities. You don't need tons of money to have fun there. Gain experiences, spend free time not just on acads but also on extra curriculars so that you develop yourself as a well rounded individual.

Like others have said, you can always celebrate, party when you are earning yourself. But even then never forget your roots. I see too many young folks entering the workforce today who suddenly have more money than they ever had access to and completely lose it.

Keep the lessons that you have learnt today and grow from them."
100,Look for an internship at some IT firm .
101,"Arre chalta hai bhai koi na...Bhot saare bday aane wale hai tere...Things will change and one day when your son will ask money for bday celebration you will in a condition where giving even 5,000 will not bother you...Keep struggling and grinding!!!"
102,"Hey OP, 
I am not sure if you are aware but there are multiple scholarships available for young people in tech . 

They can pretty much provide for your food and even hostel fee . 
Hit me up and I'll send you details of a few of them :) 

Your parents are working super hard, don't be frustrated with them. 


I understand your frustration . 
I've been there :) it sucks .
I am happy to Paytm you that amount, go enjoy your day !! 

If you are in Mumbai by any chance, lmk and I'll take you out for a nice lunch :)"
103,Just remember your father did everything he could do to give you a good life and sometimes there are shortcomings but it's up to you now to give them and to yourselves the life you wanted.
104,dont listen to all the people telling you that you are being ungrateful. a kid asking for 500rs just one day in a year? on his birthday? after already making so many sacrifices? i think we can do that instead of a 30 minutes lecture
105,"You are already doing great. Just a little more understanding and you'll be there. Good luck. 


This sounds a lot like my story. Let me share with you a story. My father created a bank account near college and deposited Rs 5000 for emergencies/urgent use when I joined college. There wasn't UPI back then he doesn't know online banking either. When I left college Rs. 4300 was left in that account. No more deposits done during the period. In those 4 years, I only spent like 1000 odd rupees to buy second hand books when survival on library books became extremely difficult when exams were nearing and I was lagging in completing syllabus.

I ate outside at restaurants/roadside dhabas only 3-4 times during my entire college tenure and didn't like being treated by friends with their money either. I used to politely avoid being in those situations. Once I got placed in 6th sem, in the final year I used to treat myself with one bread omelette every week in canteen, with another friend. Other than that it was always mess food. 

I am sure there are many people like that. So keep on and in a few years all your financial worries will be gone."
106,"Bro considering that you are not accepting help, i have a small job assignment for you, it will only take few hours of your time, just leave a message if interested. I will give you 3-4k for that.
You just have to make a google business page and add few reviews for a poor taxi -auto wala (one of the nicest,most honest person i have met in life )that i met while travelling to bhuj Gujarat, lately he cried for help as he has suffered huge losses in recent floods in mandavi ,i am doing this just inorder to promote his business,help him recover make a good living.
Also fellow redditors it would be helpful if you could give inputs on what other way i can help him, how  he can get more business, clients competing with rich taxi rental agencies etc. and also if you could leave a good review for him."
107,"Hey Happy Birthday OP!!

If you‚Äôre in IITB just lemme know, I‚Äôm a 4th year student here and would definitely like to celebrate your birthday with your friends. I‚Äôve been in situations like you and I know its hard."
108,Happy birthday! Pls send me your UPI and enjoy it guilt free. I know what it‚Äôs like to be in your position and people helped me then and I would like to pay it back
109,Are you not getting merit cum means scholarship (given for students coming from financially weak households)? In the scholarship they give you 1000 INR per month for expenses. Also a hack I used when money was tight was buying an expensive book and apply for reimbursement on it through education loan with the bill photocopy and return the book.

110,"Koi na bhai, sab sahi hoga. Maybe you can start a part time internship from 3rd sem. Easy 15-20k for 3-4 hours. Atleast that's what I was doing. Because of the internships, my college life was a breeze. Use the IIT tag."
111,"Tough times don't last but tough people do
Happy Birthday in advance

Don't hate your dad
He's in worse situation than you
Might have just removed his anger on you like all indian dads do"
112,"Hey man, GIVE ME YOUR UPI RIGHT NOW.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

On side note, I wish you to be really successful in life and get a very high paid job."
113,"Happy Birthday homie  
just let it go this once  
u can prolly afford a 5k party once u land an epic package  
i wld offer money but i myself am broke"
114,I hear your brother and I understand. Little longer just a Little longer.
115,Happy bday OP. I understand bday is very special day of year when you feel something awesome about ourself. And being rejected and scolded on top of it can be very emotionally heavy to be able to think rationally. But i am sure you will realize that you are actually are acting entitled here. Sure your father could have handle the situation better specially it's your bday. But your rant that your peers are enjoying life while you are suffering is just negative way to look at things. You are on path to success and these struggling years will feel like bitter sweet moments of your life in future when you have achieved success.
116,"I won't sugarcoat this and be quite blunt.

Even though I feel like an 18-19 y/o kid deserves 500Rs on his Bday for a basic Pizza party, this money is still in your hands.

I studied in a circuital branch in an IIT. And this just sounds wierd to me and why you are waiting for 4 years to earn good money.

Bro learn React or Django (or anything else) and get an part time internship on internshala or something. Your education loan for IITs covers a decent laptop btw. Don't wait for 4 years for packages. You have your life in your own hands right now.

Most internships will easily pay 6-10K even to freshers/second year students from an circuital branch of a top 10 IIT. This is already enough to cover most costs infact you could even send home some money. Spend 5K and save the rest to buy a phone or other gadgets/shoes/clothes. You are not the only underprivileged guy at IIT brother. There are thousands. They control their own life and hopefully you will do so soon.

Let me guess this... you are just going to classes and studying for exams? Not good enough brother. Gotta work harder. Attend sessions of tech clubs. Identify a technology you like and master it. Get internships and make projects.

Also join a good group of friends. My friend group of around 16-18 ppl from IIT, still sends cakes and gifts to each other even after graduation. That is enough to make your day. Don't be that one guy who nobody knows except your hostel wing.

Also lite le yaar, I know it must feel bad now but look at your life ahead. Also Happy BDay to you man.

PS - DM your upi ID, senior ki taraf se party manle."
117,"You were his reddit to rant. Keep calm, you'll do great. Patience is a virtue."
118,"Why don‚Äôt you earn by yourself by doing some part time job, you can earn 2-3k easily by giving tuitions to students.

Why are you crying despite knowing your family financial situation is not good. You are 18+ and matured enough to earn at least your pocket money by yourself."
119,You've every right to feel angry. The long lecture from your father was uncalled for. Words and actions leave psychological impact for years. You're a bright kid and they should be grateful too for raising a genius. It's not like you had some unreasonable demand btw. Perfectly legit.
120,Give tuition and earn money on the side.
121,"Happy birthday üéÇ.  Why don't you try for an internship as a copy writer or something? Remote work, around 4-5K stipend!!"
122,All i can say is best of luck you and i wish that you will achieve what ever the goals you want
123,"bhai ager tum top5 iit maise kisi ek me to ho bhai 1saal grind kro aur internship phod do , ro kyun rhe ho aur jab iit ke prep ke time itna nai socha to ab grind krne me kaisi sharam, kya hua 2-3 saal birthday celebrate nai kiya to life bhot badi hai bhai,btw happy birthday"
124,"OP in your first line itself you should find your answer. If your family's financial condition isn't well, you can actually help out your family by not celebrating your bday. That's a perfectly ok and rather wise thing to do... Tumhara kuch kaam nahi hone wala he bday celebrate nahi Kiya toh."
125,"Bhai you need to understand your fathers condition... Try studying hard and try to get a good paid internship if you are able to manage your studies and work together.... Your own hard earned money will make you realize what is the value of money for you or your father...

At last, I am sorry for you but you need to understand your situation and think about it wisely like a man, not like a child.... 

Agar apne dost ko ek samosa bhi dil se khilayega naa, tab bhi woh itna hi khush hoga jitna ek pizza se hota....

He‚Äôs going through crunch time and he has other priorities. So please don‚Äôt feel sad or hurt, if he wished you it‚Äôs worth more than anything.

I've been through your phase though, where I felt all my life achievements such as BITS, IIM etc are my own achievements. Only to realise how much, practically 100% I own to my parents and family.

Start practicing gratefulness, it'll help you immensely in life later also.

Since you are IITs, you must be very smart, why don't you try freelancing in your free time. Content writing, editing etc. You can earn good sum of money to spend on yourself.

And Happy Birthday bro"
173,"After reading OP‚Äôs edit, Faith in young generation has been restored now and many more happy returns of the day. I wish you will be comfortably rich, generous and happy and you are going to give the same 30 mins lesson to your kids as well, thats the cycle of life."

175,"Happy Birthday OP. As others have advised, you can find ways to earn money with internships or freelancing opportunities. Also considering the fact that you are in an IIT, try to see if there are any scholarships that you can avail.
I was in a somewhat similar situation back in college. I can relate to the feeling of not being as well to do as your peers. But trust me, 5 years down the line, you will look back at these days and feel proud of your journey."

Think of it as your fee for giving us a life reminder. So send UPI. Or buymecoffee link. Sharmao mat."
180,"Kudos to you for being aware of your family background and working hard to get a good education and consequently a good position. IIT is the cream of the crop. I‚Äôm sure your parents so proud of you being a responsible kid.

Your dad is also shouldering a lot of burden, so it‚Äôs understandable he wants you to be thrifty as much as possible. Be patient and understanding, if you‚Äôre planing to get a job right after you graduate, money waits for you in just 3 years."
181,"Oii op, I understand why you aren't accepting money from us. That's okay, but understand that we want to wish one of us a good birthday that you'll probably feel happy about. And we'll definitely be happy that we made someone's day.

Apart from that, a very very happy birthday and it's very impressive that you secured your seat in one if the top 5 IIT's. I hope you once get everything that you wish for and treat yourself."

Don‚Äôt he disheartened. You will do well."

187,"Once upon a time,I was in your place. In 2000's. The only difference is that I had to take a L and I simply bottled my thoughts and emotions.  Your post reminded me of that feeling I felt."
188,"Been there. Felt that. 

It is only now that I realise how difficult it was for him. When I would ask 500 rupees from him when I was in college, and he had scourge around in the heat, 42-43 degrees, to somehow get some money from someone and send it off to me. Those were the times without UPI so going to the bank was only option. There were also days when he would tell me the same and ask to save with whatever he sent. For context, people around me would get 5 times more from their home easily. 

He did not tell me his troubles, to ensure that I do not feel anything and I stay laser focussed. In the hindsight, I did not like that either. Thought itna lamba call ka kya zarurat tha. But now, it makes all sense. Do not worry about this, bhai. These are the learning that will carry forward and once you have a job/internship in place, things will change for you and for him - he will remember these times and tell how how times have changed and he does not even have to worry about this at all. 

Happy birthday, bhai! Do enjoy your day. I would be happy to contribute if you‚Äôd allow me to."
189,He‚Äôs a perfect father. Earn your money and spend it. You may not know what he‚Äôs going through. I lost my father 3 years ago and your father sounds like mine. Never celebrated my birthday as far as I remember. When I got married my wife bought a cake for my birthday and it felt weird celebrating. Pray to God for his good health on your birthday. He‚Äôs the best man you have. Happy birthday to you.
190,many many happy returns of the day OP!!!
191,"I wish you strength OP. I swear these hardships will end. But i am genuinely impressed with your perseverance and fortitude. God bless you! Your story is a source of inspiration. While i never faced this level of hardship, but i know my dad struggled a lot during his youth, a lot to give his children all the comfort he couldn‚Äôt have. And I can tell you, he is always so much careful with money. I have tried to learn a thing or two from him about how important money is and how to avoid extravagance.

Always keep these phases of life in memory. I wish you well and as your Reddit brother. I‚Äôm definitely ready to help out. You can pay me back whenever you can. Your friend does deserve a treat from you this once. :)

Though many have offered you money, please have an internship, learn linkedin for some time. You're an IITian, work hard and let your next generation have fun."
195,"Happy birthday!

It's OK to feel bad that you are not able to live life like your batchmates do. My only advice is don't just compare yourself with people better than you, also look at people who have less than you - the security guard bhaiya, guy who washes plates in the canteen, the contract lady who mops the corridors etc. As bad as your situation is, they have it worse. Study well. Someday you will have a good life."

204,You know decent English bro. Use it to earn money
205,"Hey man, I saw how you understood the point of your parents. For future, let me share some tips.

Always prioritise your requirements. At the top of the ladder are food, roof, bed, clothes. Next is health (both physical and mental). After that you should spend on our growth, learning, spending on things that build our career, even investment would be parallel to this expenditure. Then comes premium, and then luxury.

The definition of what comes in which category depends on your financial status. For some people pizza comes in comfort, for some people it is a luxury. I suggest you to assess your finances, and decide where an expense stands whenever you are in doubt.

This way, you will be more comfortable in spending (or avoiding spending) on something. Also, objectively speaking, in future, if you have an expense on a particular date in far yet certain future, I suggest you start saving from now. Every month if you save 50rs, you will save atleast 500rs in a year. I know this is easy for me to say, but if you really put your mind into it, you may do it.

It is not just for that. Some amount of saving may help you in any unforeseen expenses. It maybe health related, or some expensive yet essential learning course which you may not have planned."

207,"Hey, Happy birthday.

I won't call myself poor, but I grew up in the ""lower"" bracket of middle class with my widowed mom as sole earner. 32M running own business now.It is tough.

for a very weird example (I dunno if you may relate), I remember being aghast that Magnum ice cream costs so much when it launched a decade ago, and only few days ago I realized I can actually afford it, at least once in a while and ate my first one.My shirts are on an average 5 years old. That's how frugal I still am.

I know you know, but I'll still say this: Your dad believes in every rupee saved, because that will come of use when an emergency happens. Even if you get a great 50LPA package, he'll continue to believe that for a good while, because it was how he managed to bring you up on his earnings.

I was ready to UPI you too, but I'm kinda proud of you for turning us down.

Work hard and remain humble. You'll grow.  


PS: Also, I'm just adding, it is ok to be frustrated, and absolutely alright to rant it out. :)

Happy birthday again buddy."
208,"I get you. I have been in a similar situation. Did not enjoy my college as much as I should have. Get through it without any bitterness, you would become a gem. You would have a better understanding of the world and be more empathetic."

Its really easy to judge someone quickly, he might be in a bad mood, he might have worked so many hours to earn that 500. 

You have come so far.

Its first time for our parents too.

They are not perfect.

Just hustle bro, you will get a good job and get yourself and your family out of this.

Family is all."

214,"You didn't mention how your dad generally is, but since you quoted his behavior around bdays here is a piece of advice -
For events like bdays, even for others people celebrate/reflect as they do for themself. If your father isn't into it big time, how most parents are, the chances are he considers going out/celebrating with friend a waste of money. Doesn't really reflect how he is as a person"
215,"Creepy Drag, wish you a very happy birthday and wish you all the success in your career life, so that you will not have to rant about not celebrating any celebration ever in your life.

Although it is easy to write, difficult to implement, but still, I will say that, it takes a father a million hesitations to refuse an amount of money to his children. If he has denied any amount, sitting kilometers away, I can be sure that it must be difficult for him today. Because be it you/me/your dad/anyone's dad, a man's basic nature of nurturing his family never changes. It doesn't mean that your next birthday or a birthday 5 years from today will be the same. Just don't rant about your family buddy, it may give a false impression about that man who is trying to give you his best! You have a long way to go and many memories to create. :-)"

But what is a Birthday? What is any day? Like Father's day, Mother's day etc. Is it that on those days you like yourself or you Mom & Dad more than any other day?

It's all a marketing gimmick l, for people to spend money. 

You just completed another circle round the Sun on your Birthday. Hell the Sun & the other were not even on the same position on your birthday vis a vis the day you were born. 

Can't understand the hype."

223,"Hey OP,
By looking at all your comments, you seem like a very nice person and grateful for what you have in life.
While your father could have said things nicely, it's just that they are not grown up in a proper environment to know how to deal with such things. He expressed in the way he knew which might not be good but since we are mature, he can understand his intention and move on.

I have been in exactly similar position as you and had to sleep hungry when I didn't have enough money for food during my b.tech. They were really harsh years of my life. But I worked hard and now working in big tech and can afford good life. I really wish good future to you too.

225,"I wish my kids turn up like you, when they grow up. Never feel you are anyway less than any of your college mates. You don't need money to show affection towards your freinds. Just thoughtful gestures and kind note can touch people's heart.
Your parents are right in their perspective and you are completely right in yours."
226,Don't be a dick for what your parents are doing for you.

PS: Kudos to your determination and hard work. It shall pay off. Trust me."
229,Happy birthday mate. As I'm from poor financial background too and I can feel your pain but your father has to look after all so he has lots of financial burden so we need to understand them.
230,"Thank you for sharing this here. You‚Äôve made me acutely realise the privileges I have and I strive to do better. 

Happy birthday chap. Honestly the pizza is on me. Can you send your UPI?"
231,You are not ungrateful its just useless asking sincr thats your condition
232,"You are really being ungrateful here. Your parents are making bare minimum and sending whatever they can to you and stiil you have the audacity to rant just because you want to catch up with the birthday party trend. Work hard, get a good job, make your parents smile and then spend whatever and whenever you want to. My husband came from a BPL family. He sacrificed a lot of pleasures just to help his family, studied his ass off, worked his ass off and now is enjoying a good life which most people can only dream of."
233,"Hey man, you've made it this far, it's only a little more to go. Keep grinding. We need more strong people like you. With you a very happy birthday!"
234,"Happy birthday ü•≥ 
Im so sorry you have felt that way, but here‚Äôs a reminder to enjoy the day anyway 
You‚Äôre so humble, I just wish the best of job for you and reach heights and for the person that you are I bet you will be modest even after being successful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
happy birthday, may something lucky happen to you today üòä"

Btw HAPPY BIRTHDAY üéà"
237,"No idea why r/India comes up on my feed but..

Being in a difficult financial situation doesn't mean you're not allowed to get angry or upset, and being angry or upset doesn't mean you're ungrateful.

You're allowed to have feelings and you're allowed to be angry, just don't let those feelings become permanent. Once you cool down you can go back to remembering your parents are doing their best. 

Wishing you a great future my dude!"
238,"I‚Äôm short of words brother. No one is wrong in this situation honestly. I‚Äôm Grateful to god for whatever little i have, thanks for the reality check mate."

241,"At the time of college my friends use o go on trips, clubs party, road trip and all but i knew if I spend my monthly budget , there will be nothing left to manage gym diet, and I do not want to lie to my honest hardworking dad for getting some money, i know if I tell him I want money for all this he will never give , if I say i need it for project or something he will anyhow manage. So I always kept quiet , never asked anything more than he use to send every month. 

I waited till my first job , now I am spending money wherever I want .

I never felt like asking for more than required. I knew these all things seems tempting but I can wait."

243,"500 Rupees. Birthday. It brings back a painful memory.

Back when I was in my first year of college, I lended 500 rupees to my friend to spend on his first ever date. He came from a challenging financial background and I lent the money to him unprompted. He was pretty happy with my gesture. I did tell him that you should return it soon.

He actually didn't end up spending that money on that date, instead used it on something else. Possibly some family related thing. Okay, no issues.

But months went by and he didn't give it back. When it was time for my birthday, I sort of needed that 500 to treat my new college friends. I asked for it, and he said he didn't have it because he spent it on something. I got kind of pissed because I thought he should have returned it to me when he didn't spend it on the date. I was too stupid to realize he probably spent it on something important instead. 

I pushed a little, maybe a bit too much. He got pissed a little and said he would return it. Eventually he returned it through a common friend.

The gut wrenching bit was how he got that 500 rupees. Apparently he joined some catering thing and catered some wedding to earn it. When I found out about that, I felt so small. It's not like I looked down upon that line of work, but I never realized that my friends would have to do it, that too for me.

I apologized for it a lot. It really put things into perspective for me. 

I would like to think that I'm a better person now, just as I thought I was then. We can never know for sure, though. It is really these small snap under pressure decisions that we make that truly reveal who we are. 

I know this was completely unrelated to the post, but it just triggered some memories.

We are still friends, thankfully."
244,"Happy Birthday to OP! If you are in circuital branch in one of the top IIT, then you are just few years away financial independence and success. Bas kuch time ki baat hai fir apna time aayega. Good Luck!"
245,Don't worry man. You will be rich soon...
246,"Hi, chocolates and pizzas are on me. I am from a similar financial background, so I understand it‚Äôs frustrating and you can‚Äôt get angry and can‚Äôt rant. I am a doctor now so your birthday is on me! Give me your UPI. Also, I can give you an additional side money every month for you to spend. Happy birthday! :)"
247,"Think of yourself as a responsible person now. Dont ask for money. They‚Äôre already doing their best. Try to save from your expenses if u need some to have fun. 
Btw, happy birthday brother"
248,"Hey it's completely fine to feel like this
And it's good that you realise that you father works hard to run the vibe
Don't be shy share your UPI details here, consider it a gift from all of us, you deserve it!"
249,Your English is so good for a person coming from a poor background. I assume you are from South otherwise north people studying in government school cannot speak/write such nice English while still in college.
250,"Happy Birthday Buddy, I am really sorry you feel like this on a day that's supposed to be special. Share your UPI or something, a treat on me! 

But yes, this is a journey you are on and believe me when I say this this struggle really makes or breaks a person. Enjoy the process, you've already made to an IIT, soon you'll earn to provide for yourself and your family. Humble beginnings always makes warriors."
251,"Sometimes the ""lecture"" you got could have been him ranting as well about something else that went wrong. I'm sure he is proud of what you've done and is happy at how well you manage finances.

On the money front, try and see if you can pick something up for extra cash. Had a ton of friends in college who used to make money off fiver, teaching local kids, some web design stuff with passed out college seniors etc. It'll help your family as well, anyhow there is plenty of time in college"
252,Happy Birthday. Good times are ahead for you.  My father had come from a very poor background. This is the exact story he had. Now he is very successful and very rich man. What ever he touched became Gold after he graduated.  Don‚Äôt worry. You have a bright future. Your situation is not permanent. Have a great year ahead. üéÇü•≥üéâüéÅüéà

255,"Yo bro happy birthday üéä I can totally feel I also come from a similar background. A few hundred rupees was a lot for my family but I accepted the reality worked hard and got a really good job.
Don't worry one day you'll bring your family out of poverty and you'll throw a huge party for your friends and family.My dad always told me the internet you have the clothes you have the shoes, the college the education it's all luxury. Not everyone gets them in their life so appreciate it. Parents can only fulfill your requirements for your enjoyment entertainment it should be your money.

All the best ‚ù§Ô∏è

258,"I was your age. But I did understand how difficult it was for my mother to work hard and educate me just like you do and that's great. She could do it even though she had a very low paying Govt job because she lived in a village. So expenses were less. Besides my fees were around 10K a year more than a decade ago which still combined with other expenses was very hard for her, really hard and she wasn't well either. 

It was tough for me in the college. I saw my friends getting gifts, cutting cakes, getting extra money from their parents. The kind of money that I found unbelievable at that time. I felt jealous as well. Sometimes resentment - to them, to my mother sometimes (it's embarrassing but I did feel that). I didn't go to those treats or parties because I knew I couldn't return the favour. In that process I made some great friends. I saw it and understood it and used to invite me to very low scale treats or hangouts with just few friends where I wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Kind of tiny treats that I could return. Those are still my friends. We still get each other. That was a blessing out of that lack of means. Haha.

You know, she never remembered my birthday. I sometimes mentioned my birthday to her and she would just smile and caress my hair very gently. That was her way of saying what I meant to her. She didn't have the money to show that. 

You are looking at just a pizza treat worth of expenses? For him that might mean difference of a medical expense at a pharmacy where he might have to cut on some medicine purchase if need arises because he had to send that to you. No, I am not trying to make you feel guilty and I apologise if it seems like that, because it might seem. I am just trying to put some perspective to the best of my abilities.

Please know that, I am not berating you, directly or indirectly. Not at all. I also won't call you entitled either, because you are not. I am just trying to talk to you as someone who had gone through this more than a decade ago. Your emotions are normal. Justified? Nope, I don't think so and still that's okay. But your emotions are very normal. However you have to learn to see all this in perspective otherwise it will affect your future relationship with your own family. You won't like that. Please don't get into that. It might seem like a small rant right now, but these things fester, if not put into perspective in time. All parents don't love their kids the same. It all depends on means and circumstances. 

You see, I meant the world to my mother. We literally had just each other. But still she couldn't do more than that. It took me some time to realise it was not everything she gave me but she gave me enough and that enough was everything.

I think you are a good son an a good kid :) Happy birthday!"
259,Laa bhai.. have one pizza from my side. Share your upi and I'll send you some. Happy Birthday btw
260,Work part time???
261,"I don't ask my dad but yeah, this is what my dad would exactly do!"
262,"bhai, teri poori party sponser karunga, recursion krrade bas"
263,"I think your parents are really poor and they are trying . So when they heard pizza party they might not have been able to understand . I think if you had said about wanting more money because you starve to sleep most nights maybe they might have given . But I don‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt know if your parents have been neglectful and abusive or simply too poor . 

Yea if you don‚Äôt have money to eat then it is wrong they gave birth to you when they can‚Äôt even afford . But look how far you have come in life . Also I think your mom really loves you . 

Now after achieving so much is not the time to feel disheartened . As soon as you graduate you will be set for life . 

I feel really sad that you starved to sleep many times but you are unwilling to let anyone pay for you  here . Anyway I hope your friend will understand . 

look at the bright side . My husband is also from  lower middle class family and he is very studious  . But during his previous years of study his father made him work for hours ( child labour ) . Atleast you got the chance to study and you are in IIT now . Not saying to compare but to look at the bright side of things . You have a bright future ahead ."
264,I can help you op . You can give your upi in my dm.
265,I cannot give you financial insight as I‚Äôm not in the same position as you. But I can give you some psychology insight about ‚Äúlosing out on enjoying your college life‚Äù. Everyone in college has different reasons to feel it. Trust that you‚Äôre not alone in this and your challenges are different. Someone might be having lots of money but not attractive and single. Someone in my own class had chronic disease that prevented him from being able to have intercourse. Imagine that in your 20s. I‚Äôm graduate of IIT Guwahati btw. 2021
266,"When i was in the 6th grade my friends decided to do a samosa party during lunch. A samosa cost 2 bucks. I asked my mother for the money and she did not give me any. Years later i was teasing her about being so tight fisted with money when we were young, she told me that she would run out of money within a week of getting paid and I had asked her for 2 rupees on the 27th of that month and that she had 25 rs in her wallet. It hit me so hard. I never brought it up again. I can't even imagine how hard it must have been."

268,bhai freelance kar kuch bhi part time naukri kar. ab tu adult hai be grateful 1000 bhi mil rahe hai. ab tak u shud atleast earn enough to afford basic neccesities yourself. 3 - 4 ghante waiter ki naukri bhi karega every alternate day toh bhi thode bohot paise kama lega. varna online freelancing is genuinely the best option. research a bit and earn money urself. anyways is birthday ko kharab mat kar sad hoke but goal rakh ki next bday apni kamai se party dega doston ko aur apni family ko bhi! papa ko acha lagega. happy bday bro
269,"I can relate bro. I was dead poor but my father made sure that all of us had a nice bday and everything. our monthly income till 2013 was legit 7.5k pm. thankfully we got a lil better later but kabbadi with the poverty line remains on to this day. me and my brother worked ok the side to make some extra cash and rn I have a good internship and a top 1% salary job offer in my hand when I graduate next year. it's all good bro. Send me ur upi or ur address. I know what shitty bdays feel like. Whatever u want, on me, this year."
270,"Bro, I see the problem here. Maybe you're feeling this because your family tried to cut the costs on unnecessary things as much as possible. Of course, it's common for Indian parents to lecture on things they should explain properly.

As you said your family has roughly 5k to spend for a family of four, It is roughly 1200 per person and there will always be unexpected expenses in the house. So, it's still a little hard to keep sending 1k every month. 

You can either use existing skills to tutor or get freelance jobs to make some money for your needs or try internships as everyone else's suggestion.

You understand the situation and tried asking, but it feels like sht to get lectured for that, but parents always have things to worry about and they release their stress this way without being conscious about it.

My parents do this kind of things(not financial) but later, when I'm calm, I think if i conveyed my message properly and did I talk in the right time."
271,"Thanks for sharing this story here man. Kudos to you for working hard. Keep it up and make sure you don't hold any grudge over your dad. It surely hurts him more to not be able to provide for you. 
Get a great job and take your roommate to a great restaurant. And your parents and your uncle as well."
272,"Hey OP! 
Happy birthday my man. As you can already tell we all are really proud of you. 

I‚Äôd love to connect with you. I‚Äôm a graduate from IITB and I have friends who might be hiring developers. We are always very keen on helping out our fellow juniors, especially hardworking genuine people like you. 

Cheers!"
273,"Your father gave you 30 min lecture. I was about to give you an hour long one but good people of reddit have already knocked some senses in you so I will just smile for now. Keep working hard, make your father proud."
274,"Happy birthday bro. Sorry to hear, but your father also had no other option but to reject."
275,MY DAD DIDNT EVEN REALISE IT WAS BIRTHDAY üòû. I hope you don't get hung on to that sad day like I did for a long while.
276,Wishing u a great future ahead!
277,Happy Birthday Broooooo!
278,"Kyun bday ke din gaali khane ke kaam kar raha hai. Parents do more than what they can for their children. If they can send 700, they send 1000 somehow. And still you think you deserve more because your friends have more? Such an ungrateful twat!

I came from exactly this situation. Have skipped bday parties of friends in school coz I knew we can't afford to pay for bday presents, forget giving treats on my own bday. But instead of complaining and being entitled, I started giving tuitions when I was in 8th standard and supported the family income. Then started freelancing after school for my own pocket money and expenses that I couldn't justify asking money from my dad (like getting a used phone for 1200, paying 199 for the monthly recharge etc).

Thankfully, all that paid off in the end and now my parents are living a good life after retirement. Make sure you do that as well and raise their living standards when you start earning."
279,"Hey bro Happy birthday

I totally understand you. I was exactly in the same financial condition as you are 4yrs ago. And at times it feels sad to not be able to spend on some fancy things but believe me you will be proud of yourself in some years and then you will have a lot to spend and then you can treat your friend well. 
And then maybe you can give your dad a big treat on his bday as well 

Also,
Your family is doing a lot more sacrifices than you can even imagine. Your father will definitely be slogging his ass off for that important 5k 6k and 500 is like 10% of the household income. Your mom n dad might be saying no to a lot of comforts so they can keep the house fed.

And lastly, I hope this helps, I was in the same condition and now( after 4yrs) am able to take my parents to take them to the most fancy places and then the smile you see on them. That's the only thing I want to earn. 

Upskill, earn, pamper family and yourself!

All the best."
280,"I don't think you're ungrateful and I dont think you're wrong in wanting to celebrate, just because you come from a financial background that doesn't allow for more activities. You truly do deserve to have what you like. I would be more than happy to help if you could dm me!"
281,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! You‚Äôre totally valid to feel that. I feel that too sometimes. It can be super frustrating when money is a problem or when parents cant afford to buy you nice things. You are not being ungrateful. However, you can work hard and buy yourself all the things you‚Äôve ever wanted with the your own hard earned money one day. 

Your parents love you and im sure they worry about not being able provide a life you want but its not their fault they are doing their best.

You can celebrate your birthday by doing things you don‚Äôt usually do or don‚Äôt have time to do. Like watching a movie, go on a walk. Its your day, its up to you how you enjoy it."
282,Happy birthday OP !!!!!!!
283,"Happy birthday brother üéâ, don't be sad for whatever happened I'm sure next year there'll be a grand celebration , my wishes are with you ."

289,Happy birthday bhai.People with more financial problems than me are working hard and coming up in life while I am still trying to figure out things in life. All the best bhai. You'll go placesüòä‚ù§Ô∏è
290,Please update us with your first salary news in few years!!
291,"OP, it's okay. I've been at your place, take these experiences as a motivation. Just hang tight and believe in yourself to work harder. You already are in an IIT, just few more years of hard work will fix all these financial issues. Your father is gonna be proud of you and never question your spending habits once you become independent."
292,"You know what take the money. Take it and when you earn pay all of it forward. 

Tumhara din bhi ban jayega and sab khush bhi honge they did something good.

Happy bday bro. 500 ho jaye to accept karne se mana kardena. But please accept the 500 atleast yaar."
293,I feel so sad for you. I really hope you get a good job after 4 years.
294,"Can ppl stop offering money to entitled ppl pls.
He literally knows his family is hand to mouth and is complaining.
Your father has fed you his entire life & probably never complained once that no one gave him freebies even on days he needed them.
He still continues to support you inspite of his shortcomings‚Ä¶ I think you need to be grateful that you get to eat daily and are not starving."
295,"Hey OP, all big IITs have a Merit-cum-Means Scholarship known as MCM. It is pretty easy to get the scholarship if your family income is less and you can maintain a decent CPI. It has decent amount, enough that you won't need to ask your parents to send you money.

There are other scholarships as well,but they can get competitive depending on your circumstances. MCM is available to all low income students. Definitely, apply for it and you can focus on your studies without your parents having to send money to you."
296,Happy birthday buddy
297,Bhai give your UPI
298,"My parents used to only give me 20 rs. everyday when i went to college, i knew we didn't have much money so I didn't complain but people used to laugh at how much little money i have so it was hard. Now i have a steady govt job and rebuilt my home. The struggles made me focus. We should thank our parents on our birthday because they gave life to us. That is what I think"
299,"For a seemingly smart kid you sure are pretty stupid. 
If I asked my father for money after 18 he would tell me to go to sleep hungry, then I would learn how to live within my means. 

Your parents are even sending you money every month, I don‚Äôt think you realise how lucky you are.

You should quickly start helping out your parents instead of asking for money.

Congratulations on IIT tho, good job"
300,Happy Birthday friend!
301,!remind me in a year
302,Brooo send your UPI man!!!!!!!!
303,"I wanted to address your first edit.

You weren't being ungrateful - everyone gets frustrated, and sometimes it's okay to rant. 
Especially when everyone else around you is living a different life.

Ranting doesn't discredit your parents' hard work, and it's okay to feel your emotions. 

Don't ever apologize for that.

And maybe it isn't the best but you can try pizza mania from dominos - it's cheaper."
304,Happy birthday bhai üéâüéâüéâ
305,"Happy Birthday OP. Wouldn't mind chipping something in for celebrating your birthday but it seems you have already refused other people's similar offers. You deserve to have a good time on your birthday for all the hard work you have done so far. Feel free to DM your UPI id, if you change your mind."
306,"It's a matter of 4-5 b'days more. Those Rs 150 your mom arranged is probably the best gift you got today. Just never ever forget it.

307,"Hey!! Happy birthday!!

Tonight's pizza on me! Pls DM"

309,Enjoy the karma points. Happy birthday.
310,"Hey brother just to answer your current and future rants ... the answer is you will end up being burnt out :) 

The thing is I too got to learn this later on but at any stage unless you are happy you can't keep your parents or your wife happy. 

When your father called you to tell you why asking for 500 / partying is wrong tell me that you didn't think of this > ""yaar itna kch kr rha hu lekin mere time pe inko samjh hi nai ata hai ""

Remember to give priority to yourself also ... in this case I know you are not earning and can't arrange funds... but yes there are too many ideas by which you can earn and manage all these expenses yourself."
311,"This reminds me of my college days. My parents struggled a lot to send me money and it was always my mother who secretly sent me extra to enjoy a little. There are also a lot of people who helped me out.

If you are keen on studying and working hard on yourself, I can sponsor you a pizza party every month till you start earning. You shouldn‚Äôt go hungry any day.  

Let me know if you want any other help like getting internship or in your study too. Or if you just wanna talk."

But if possible and time permits, why don‚Äôt u find easy ways of some second hand earnings?
I know IIT is super tough
But being an IIT student is a brand in itself 
If u take 1-2 tuitions for 1-2 hours in the weekend 
It will give u atleast 2-3k right?

Or find other means to earn a lil

330,WHERE TF IS YOUR UPIIIIIII???
331,I have been there and feel you. I know you won‚Äôt take the money that‚Äôs the best part. Keep your head high and move on. You‚Äôll rock your world
332,this comment section is making me cry. wholesomeüíó
333,"I feel you bro. I was in the same boat as you. During my graduation (2015-19), my monthly pocket money was 1000 in 1st year and by the end of final year, it was 2000. But I wasn't in IIT.

But whatever I know little bit about parents and from my own experience, that lecture wasn't for you. It's is his frustration (for the lack of better word) to not be able to give you 500.

Work hard and make your parents proud."
334,"Hey! You are awesome to be working hard & being so confident ull get a nice package. I'm sure your hardwork & sacrifices will pay off. But you know..I've been where you are right now. Poverty is the biggest pain in life..& I'm also working hard rn to get thru it & also get thru my mental issues like depression, anxiety etc.
Just stay strong bro, I get you.. believe me..you can cook something for your friend if you have a kitchen where you live..if even that's not possible.. tell your friend the truth & anybody who's truly your friend will stick by you & understand you. So, be honest with them. Much love xoxo ‚ô•Ô∏è"
335,"This is such a wholesome thread. OP I'm proud of all you have done and what you plan to do. It's inspiring really. I completely understand your disappointment, and I hope you have a better birthday next year. Your mom knows you didn't do anything wrong, and I guess your dad is taking on the role of being the bad cop to ensure everyone can meet their needs in the family. That's a stressful role to take, and can lead into some misdirected anger or frustration. Try not to take it to your heart, and I hope you have a wonderful year ahead."
336,And now I fell the Spark of humanity again inside me sach me this is just toooo beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
337,"Your father failed you on these, my parents were dirt poor couldn‚Äôt even eat 2 time a day that kind of poor but my grandparents did there best to provide whatever they could. They tell me stories all the time of how poor they were even then my grandparents tried to give them gift and how precious it was to them so precious in fact that you can‚Äôt value it in money, priceless according to them. These are moments that hold the greatest value of our existence not some arbitrary value in your bank account. These kind of memories kind of stick to us for a life time."
338,Happy birthday
339,"These comments really passed the vibe check! 
Enough to make a grown man tear up. 
Happy Birthday OP üéÇ"
340,Pizza on me! Share your upi or address I‚Äôll get it for u.
341,"I don't know how things are with your father, but based on what you have shared, I think your father is under stress due to the tight budget due to which he may have told you those things. It is understandable. I think you'd do really well later in your life, given that you are in IIT.  Also it's nice that you have such a sweet mother who went out of her way to give you this gift.

As for pocket money, get a side gig. Do some sort of work/job and earn some money. It will give you sense of fulfillment and also make you a bit independant."
342,W dad.
343,Bro Tell me How can i send you Money im a broke Student but i can send you like 50‚Ç¨
344,We can all pool some money up man.. don't think about it just enjoy your day. we're all your friends. Some things you're offered are things you deserve.

346,"Upi bhej de chote, meri taraf se pizza free"
347,Happy Birthday bro better days will come don't worry
348,It's not just about birthday but I don't think so you should sleep hungry. Maybe we can pitch in some. Maybe even just 50-100 each so that at least you can afford to look after yourself when it's tough?
349,Happy Birthday Bro. Send me your QR.
350,Happy birthday Dude!!
351,"Hey if you are in college you can teach people who are wanting to go into IITs there is a app called HashLearn and other websites like Chegg India, TutorMe, Tutoreye which can help you earn money while teaching

That's how I crossed my college life, hope it helps. Happy birthday brother, would be happy to help if anything is needed"
352,"i can understand. you are correct from your perpective and so is your father. Try to understand his perspective as well. ik its difficult. I also have been in that position. But you can change your life by maintaining your hard work.

Good luck üëç"
353,"I understand both of your sides. However, your father didn't need to lecture you on this and take his frustration out on you. 
You were not ungrateful or anything like that, you worked hard as kid too and gave all your part time money to him, so you definitely don't need to feel guilty about this incident. 
In zomato app, for first time users you can get discount and I got a rs 250 small pizza once. You can try it"
354,Perhaps the wisdom he gave you is worth many MORE RUPEES.  You must listen to your father if you wish to prosper!
355,Happy Birthday. Wishing you all the happiness in the world and i hope a day will come in your life when you will be celebrating your birthday with your loved ones at a place of your dreams.

360,"You cannot change you current reality, accept it and work to improve it.

I have a few friends and they say get ample of free time in IITs.

You could look for paid internships in the field that you are passionate about. This helps you in 2 ways improves your current financial condition, 2nd give you industry experience."

364,"Send your UPI, I'll try and send you 2500 INR each month, till your graduation, and you securing a job.
If you do good in life, return the money back to me someday. No pressure.
Let's see if humanity still has the honor system left.
What say?"
365,"Why don‚Äôt we all throw a party for you?

Happy birthday, bro :) Give us your UPI.."
366,Those who got more than enough money don't care about celebrating birthday anymore and those who want their birthday to be celebrated are running low on money. Weird world we live in.
367,"Happy birthday bhai.
DM me your UPI, I'll send you some money for your celebration. Don't think of your father any less, he is giving you everything possible trust me. 
Also, you can ask for TA work from professors, that will definitely provide you some 3k to 4k per month."
368,Do you not have a jorb? I can't imagine asking my parents for money for a pizza party when I was in school lmao.
369,Shit got real wholesome y real fast

373,US bro
374,Happy belated bday bro!! U can send UPI address to me
375,U r going to make more money than 70% of redditors here
376,"Hi OP, Idk how you're being ungrateful. I felt that you have a point. Your father felt that he couldn't send you 500, fine given his financial constraints but why lecture. Who in your age doesn't want to spend?  But hey on the bright side look at how far you have come. Just a lil push and there is a bright future ahead of you man. I was in a similar situation like you. My family doesn't have bad financial conditions but they are toxic, they fucked up my mental condition and I had to manage with Rs800 per month in a tier 1 city. From personal experience it will get better as it did with me. Saying that happy birthday OP and if you still want a pizza party consider it done(saying cuz many already in the comments incl your seniors said they will give you on), send me your upi id in dm. Enjoy your day man."

400,"Simple question to these #WETOO idiots. If India already knew everything thousands of years before the west and we were soo advanced, wtf happened? Why is the west considered the first world and developed, while India is still developing? If we had such advanced levels of intelligence and technology, how were our ancestors unable to defend themselves against invaders and allow themselves to be systematically looted, plundered and destroyed by those same barbarian external aggressors?

Ofcourse ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Indian were good at it and one of the first ones before mathematics became a sophisticated discipline. They even exchanged ideas on math and astronomy. But to attribute everything to the indians , while glossing over the Greeks is just emotional hindutva or hyper ancient-centric nationalism. It's just reductive to claim that ancient India was all hunky dory in maths and science until Christians came and stole them. Greeks existed before christianity."

412,"Wanted to clear up some things.

I don't know why this waste of matter calls einstein a fraud. It was Newton and Leibniz who came up with Calculus. 

Although not widely known, an Indian did come up with Calculus almost 200 years before Newton was born. His name was Sangamagrama Madhavan. Evidence connecting his work and that of Newton is yet to be found."

433,"I am hearing good things about Hyderabad, if you are looking for an upcoming Tier 1 city.

If you are OK with Tier 2 places...

If you are from Mumbai or around, you can check out:

1. Nashik  
Nothing particular here, I find the city to be a nice location!
2. Kolhapur  
Pros: Great foodie culture, specifically for folks who like non veg
3. Konkan cities like Ratnagiri  
Pros: Proximity to Goa, lots of scenic places. Great seafood.  
Cons: Heavy rainfall, infra is not as good, so outages are a possibility.

I have heard that the weather around Bangalore is superb, but the city itself has lost out because of the number of people vs the available infrastructure.

So a good way to take advantage of the good weather without getting hit by the infra issues is to move to a nearby location like Mysore, Shivamogga or similar."

Has an international airport, connected by railways. Health care is decent The city has got some of the finest colleges and universities of the state. IT scene is decent. The city is in close proximity to locations like Varkala, Kanyakumari and couple of less explored hill stations like Ponmudi, Vithura. Air Quality remains decent throughout the year. 

The city just has two seasons rain and summer and also the climate remains humid throughout the year. Trivandrum is located near the tip of indian peninsula so getting to any other place would be bit time consuming especially if you are traveling by road or rail. No metro so vehicle is a must have  especially if your house not located close to the highway. The city had a garbage problem sometime back but that has started improving gradually.

It's my native place so I might be biased at some places.  I hope to retire in Trivandrum someday."
439,Coimbatore
440,"Shift to tier-2 city.

Lot of stupid suggestion in comment section. Please don't pick tourist cities like Dehradun etc. 

I would suggest Maharashtra. It's developed state, more opportunities, no communal tension, sea shore, center on Indian map. No language discrimination. Low crime rate. Lot of quality educational institutions. 

Pick tier 2 cities like Nashik or Outskirts of Pune."

I‚Äôm living in Gurgaon currently (near Golf Course Road) and I think it‚Äôs best compromise (affordable and peaceful living options, good connectivity to delhi and decent people).

All the benefits of living in Mumbai without the headaches of Mumbai. Great schools, reasonable rents, great hospitals, a planned city like Chandigarh but definitely better, greenery everywhere, huge gardens in the middle of neighbourhoods, low crime, great entertainment options nearby, accessible nature and hills for trekking, open minded community, and a lot of young couples with kids. Reasonably good public transport with local trains and buses, and a metro and new local train lines are coming up too.

Another option could be Thane - but it is not as good as Navi Mumbai in my opinion."
463,"Since I didn't see any comments for Surat so i will suggest you Surat.

Relatively cheap compare to the similar size city to it like Pune and ahemdabad. Good transportation. Auto rikshaw are really cheap here. 

Friendly to all parts of Indian. If you hindi than you don't even have to try learning Gujarati. Large amount of people from all over India here. Really peaceful and one of the safest city in India. 

There are 2-3 beach also nearby and saputara hill station and other hill station are also nearby (but doesn't have great hight compared to Himalayas.) Also riverfront is nice. 

I saw your comment that your budget is 70-80 lacs for 3BHK. In that budget you can definitely find flats or raw house in one of posh area. 

Roads are nice. Traffic is also not a major issue(other than in textile market area where metro work is in progress). But that is also avoidable because highest no of bridges in India are in Surat. 

Street food is really nice. You can get vadapav, Chinese (not a big fan of momos here, rather than Manchurian is really good here). Gujarati snacks and khaman is damn good. 

Enjoy's all fastival on large scale. Like janmashtmi, ganesh chaturthi, navratri, diwali, Holi. Also on similar scale for Muslim fastivals also. 

For education you can find all the top school of India are here. For medical emergency you can find really good hospital as well."
464,"Me wondering, What Central govt job offers choice of cities for transfers."
465,"Navi Mumbai

It's like a secret city, having the planning on par with any of the Asian tigers.

Safe, mostly away from pollution, few of the best schools. Good hospitals, good public transport, not too hot nor too cold (rains a bit much still never floods)

And close enough to Mumbai to provide everything luxury india has to offer.

Choose Vashi, see woods, or Kharghar."
466,"Chandigarh but I have read your reason in reply as why you would not move there

522,Surprised to see no one else has suggested Navi Mumbai or any of the suburbs there. They are one of the most well planned places to live in the country. Some have better infrastructure than most of Mumbai and there's a second airport coming in the region so you should look into that.

U can consider Raipur or bilaspur or durg or even korba, can easily get a 3 bhk for 70-80 laks. Good schools are there . Also u can try MP cities such as Indore jabalpur Bhopal even.

614,"I faced a similar situation when I had to live in my village for a while. My grandmother waited on the men hand and foot, and while she never directly asked me to work, it was clearly expected of me.  It took some effort (and small fights lol) , but by the time I left my grandfather had begun to do small stuff like stirring the curry and cutting onions. so baby steps :)

The only way unsavoury traditions change is from the inside. One thing you can do is take up the work that's expected of her, this will change the dynamic in the house. Don't wait until an argument, just go and clear up, serve people, clean etc."
615,If you both contribute to the household equally then I see no reason for her to toil away just to please your parents back home. Put your foot down and put it as such to your parents
616,"Dude, grow some shiny spine and have a frank talk with your mother. Don‚Äôt not, I repeat do not make your wife the villain in that conversation. You have to shoulder this one. Your family your burden. 

Here is how I approached with my mother 

	1.	Personal Beliefs: Explained that my perspective is rooted in my personal beliefs and values, which differ from hers. I chose a partner compatible with my beliefs. So it is not about her, it‚Äôs about me. 
	2.	Understanding: Express your desire to explain your viewpoint better and have an open dialogue.
	3.	Questions: Ask questions to gain insight into her reasons for supporting gender-affirming roles.
	4.	Share Concerns: Share your concerns honestly but respectfully, emphasizing that it‚Äôs important to have a conversation instead of tip toeing around it. 

Have this conversation a month in advance of the visit so that she has time to normalise her thoughts and feelings. 

During visit, volunteer to do things before your mother has a chance to conscript your wife. Let there me raises eyebrows. It‚Äôs your chance to show your wife that she has a partner with a shiny spine who will stand by her. 

All the best."
617,"Lmao, you wife is the one getting short handed and you are the one facing the mental agony? ü•¥ Whole bunch of me, me and me in this post. Dude, if you didn't wanted to deal with this you could have married a homemaker who would have abided by the rules of your mother.

You want your wife to follow traditional roles at your home AND also earn money. Then you have gall to say that it is a minor problem and should be overlooked by your wife. So you expect your wife to overlook being treated like a second class citizen at your home? Jesus, grow a fucking spine and talk to your mother. Tell her that you divide everyhing equally and that's how your equation works and she shouldn't be expecting traditional gender roles from your wife. Get up and do your part of tasks in India too. Just because you changed the country, you won't combust if you pick a broom. Your wife shouldn't suffer because your parents are misogynistic. This mental agony is just your complacency and need to not rock the boat with your mother."
618,Grow a spine.You are not suffering lol stop making this about yourself
619,">My mother expects her to conform to traditional gender roles, while my wife expects us to continue splitting household chores equally, as we do abroad.

Here you need to make your mother understand and if she can't tell her you will stop coming. That should do the trick.

>My wife dislikes the traditional gender role expectations and references.
She also resents the traditional expectations placed on her as a daughter-in-law by my parents.

Not really sure what you mean by these but based on what I have seen around me, if your parents are conservative, the best approach is to take small steps. Sudden changes will not do you any good. Agree to a few of their demands and then start imposing your views. 


Just talks to your parents first. A threat of stopping visits works quite well in many cases."
620,"Aww poor you! What about your wife  suffering or does it even matter? It's for few days that she has to do the work, so, it's just few days only for you to suffer also.  How amazingly you are becoming victim in this situation where clearly it's your wife who is suffering."
621,"You being spineless and acting like the victim is classic indian behavior.

Grow up, talk to your parents and put them in their place or just tell your wife you‚Äôre too week to ever stand up for her and let her marry someone better.

The victim mentality here is pathetic, if you can‚Äôt even handle that, do therapy before going home"
622,"If your happy place is abroad where you and your wife share the work, then put your foot down in front of your mother about this. A no compromise position. Threaten to never visit them again if they dont agree. Parents need to know that they are absolutely powerless once the kids grow up. When they realise that they have no power, they will obediently fall in line."
623,"What have you tried to solve the problem, if at all?"
624,"Your wife is your priority. Parents should not force their opinions on kids once they[kids] get married.

Sure, respect your parents, but be firm with your stand."
625,"Ah, the classic Indian male :)"
626,"Rent a home stay at a nice resort town, or a temple town. Take the first circle of family along with you. The staff does all the chores, sit with the wife and mom and play a game of rumy, carrom or antakshari. 

I have been married 23 years with similar backgrounds.  We did this often, took both parents and in laws along. This vacation home setup with no chores, breaks the traditional setup, and traditional roles. They are all forced to get along.

Keep the India trip short and sweet, make good memories, reject all negativity from everyone."
627,"What's there to advise?? What's stopping you from putting your foot down to your mother??

You married a forward thinking woman who is financially contributing to the family. Plus, splitting chores seems like a healthy living relationship in 2023.

How do the parents get to have a say in the nitty-gritty dynamics of the marriage of two fully grown individuals. This is beyond my comprehension.

It's you and your wife who decides how you will run the house. So ask yourself, are you happy sharing the chores. If yes, it's time your mother stops (stfu) with the expectations."
628,"In this case, your wife is the outsider in your house. So, it is important to  support her. I was in a similar situation during the corona lock down. My wife used to work for more than 10 hours during that time and it was difficult to manage the kid and household chores. My family is traditional and we never used to have a maid for cooking because of some traditional beliefs. Whenever my mother hints about the lack of contribution from my wife, even when she used to clean and cut vegetables at night, I asked to get a maid. My wife couldn't have asked for the same to my mother. It helped a bit, but my mother still complained about her lack of contribution even with a maid. There is absolutely no way to change their beliefs completely. 

Eventually, we moved out because of child's education. Right now, I believe that I should have done it a long before."
629,"Grow up, and tell your parents to back the fuck down. Its that simple. Stop prattling on about agony and picking fights with your wife for her perfectly reasonable demands. You're going to push her out of your life with your shitty attitude.

Tell your parents that they don't get to dictate how you and your wife live your lives. How work is divided. Did you tell your mom and dad how to do the chores? What a mother or father's duties are? Husband or Wife's?

If they cannot learn to respect your wife and her boundaries, then go low contact. Stop visiting them until they learn to accept your wife. Or visit them in extremely limited ways. Quick day visits. But ultimately whatever works for your wife, because frankly she's the one who has to deal with their dehumanizing, patriarchal nonsense."
630,Men and their sheer fucking audacity to complain when their wife's clearly the victim.
631,"From one man to another - Statistically, you‚Äôll spend more time with your wife  and she should be your no.1. Stand up for her."
632,"You'll have to confront your mother..you can't expect your wife to all the chor s just to please your parents.
You do not have to find a balance between two worlds, just tell your parents that this is how you guys live your life and thisbis waht you believe to be ok"
633,"You should have a talk with your parents about splitting house work, but if you do, they will feel that your wife has manipulated you, changed you etc, you know the usual serial drama. So only have the talk if you are skilled enough to manipulate and convince them without having them think that your wife is a villain. When you are at your house, just continue to live as you did abroad, split house work, do chores. If your parents intervene, tell them that you are doing it willingly and that its good to know how to manage the house, be it a man or a woman, that the house belongs to the both of you and so both should manage it. You can also tell them about how you saw your mother doing the housework alone since childhood and from there learnt that you should contribute too. All this can probably convince them that your wife isnt the villain in the story, or atleast make them less scrutinising of her. When it comes to Indian parents, direct talks can often result in them going more forceful about their beliefs, so subtle manipulation it is, with sugary positive words."
634,"This issue is what has created a deep divide between my husband and I. My parents were against our marriage and I had to fight a lot and go through so much mental trauma to make them finally accept our marriage. I stood up for us. 

When I visited his family same situation, expectations from a traditional bahu. My husband expected me to deal with the situation and not complain. He did not show the same courage against his family that he expected from me against mine. 

I can say I lost a lot of respect for him then. I keep my visits to in-laws extremely short. Going back to India is a vacation for my husband and agony for me for this reason. I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs fair.  I haven‚Äôt been to India in over 6 years and this year when I go I am visiting my husband‚Äôs family for 3 days. I feel bad for my in-laws having a very short time with their grandchildren but I feel that‚Äôs a choice they made when they chose to treat me so poorly."
635,"How comfortably you said that ‚Äúthese may seem like minor problems and can be overlooked by my wife‚Äù is what‚Äôs making me thing that you don‚Äôt really understand her. I also live abroad with my husband, have a good career, earn well and we also visit India since both our families live there and I also don‚Äôt believe in conforming to the traditional expectations placed on a daughter-in-law. My in-laws are really sweet and they don‚Äôt really expect me to be that way but if that day ever comes, I will expect my husband to support me. It is unfair that the man gets treated like a king at his in-laws place but the woman is expected to work at her in-laws place when she is also just visiting from abroad like her husband. Our generation needs to bring this change and it can only happen if the husbands support their wives and demand that they be treated equally. It may feel like a difficult conversation to have with your mother at first but you NEED to have this conversation if you want a good relationship between your parents and your wife otherwise it will take a toll in your relationship with your wife as well. Hope you think about it."
636,Your Wife deserve someone better..
637,"You spend equal time in both houses. Do you do all the chores in her house while visiting her parents and she sits comfortably in her home? If no, then same applies to your house as well."
638,You deal with it by taking your wife‚Äôs side and telling your family to back off.
639,Awww bechara. Grow a spine you fuckin loser.
640,She's your wife not your parents wife. Don't be a dumbass.
641,"You're completely right. Why shouldn't your wife adjust to your parents outmoded dakyanusi expectations? 

I hope you have a lawyer, because this path is a thorny one and will lead to a divorce court.

Other option is to grow a backbone and stop acting like a spineless creature. Tell you parents firmly and clearly that your wife is a modern woman and that they cannot place such demands on her. You could, y'know, SUPPORT HER!"
642,"You don't need to bring her to your house.

You can go to your house and she to hers. 

It's not that difficult."
643,"I think you should take a stand for your wife ans discuss this with your parents! She should not have to go through so much just cause she wants to be treated equally. Being elder does not mean they are right and these things are okay for them to do. 
As far as your mental health is concerned, once you have explained your parents the case 
There should be no more discussion"
644,"So to clarify you are saying you want your wife to conform to gender roles, meaning do all the household chores single handedly simply to keep your parents happy, when the understanding between you two is to divide the work, and YOU are the one going through mental agony? Your wife is the one who should be complaining of mental agony, owing to betrayal by her otherwise so called progressive husband. You're the AH."
645,"This is a genuine question, but have you tried speaking to your parents about this? You need to lay it out to them that you two work in a certain dynamic when you are abroad, and that does not need to change simply for the few days you are visiting India. 

If both you and your wife are okay with the arrangement, then you shouldn't let your parents dictate how that dynamic should change. You said that this is something that could be overlooked by your wife, but that seems like you are not willing to take the effort required to make your parents accept how you two function as a couple. 

At the end of the day, you need to realise that you are expecting your wife to take on additional work, during what I assume is a vacation, to simply put up a front for YOUR parents. This is something you need to handle with your parents, as I'm sure your wife would have no issue laying out her feelings on her own, though that may damage relationships."
646,"Ah the age old problem. You should do what‚Äôs morally correct. And you know what that is. 

(If it isn‚Äôt obvious, put your foot down and split the chores, not to please your wife but cuz it‚Äôs the right thing to do)."
647,"How you frame it defines your issue..this is not a ‚Äòcultural expectation‚Äô, this is a problem of adhering to embedded social constructs that are no longer valid in your current life."
648,"Yes, your wife being harassed by an asshole sexist MIL must be very difficult for YOU. Grow a fucking spine and stop being a mummy's raja beta."

654,"> as I'm caught in the middle and don't know how to handle it. I understand my wife's perspective, but I also don't want to endure this mental agony.

Very simple. You've gotta stand up for your wife and explain to your parents this isn't the 1960s. Your parents having stereotypical gender role expectations is totally their problem, not your wife's. 

Just be firm with them and set clear boundaries. I understand there'll be a lot of drama that'll ensue - but this is totally up to you to back up your wife. 

I'm saying this as a guy who's faced a similar situation with relatives. DM if you wanna chat more"
655,"If you are okay with splitting the house chores abroad as well as in India, why don‚Äôt you speak with your mom and make her realise that it‚Äôs your personal choice and not your wife putting it on you. There‚Äôs high chance of them taking it all wrong, they don‚Äôt want to see their son suffering doing housework while your wife should work and manage house as well. I personally feel you should make her feel at home , if you‚Äôre going through whatever you‚Äôre feeling, imagine her situation, her suffering. I get it there‚Äôs nothing wrong in doing housework but it‚Äôs always good if there‚Äôs help . And it‚Äôs better to solve this before you all starts hating it here. Or else you‚Äôll end up not visiting your parents in the long run or you‚Äôll have to come just for name sake, the whole point of love care towards your family will be lost due to these small issues once it gets piled up"

662,"I think others gave some valid suggestions even though some of them may be rude. Incase you cannot split chores equally, Make sure you do everything for few days once you return back to the foreign country you are living, Since your wife would have done everything here while also conforming to your mother's wishes. 
But the above is just a temporary solution, If you cannot take a stand here it may continue to other aspects of life too."
663,Tell your wife to follow these gender norms in India. Tell her to do chores or whatever your parents expects. But when you go back abroad you have to do all the chores and she will rest. Just a thought from my side. But you should continue spliting chores in India too.
664,haha this is my story except i live in india and with my parents.. it took me few years to brainwashing them into accepting me and my wife as equals when it comes to chores.. as a side effect my dad started helping out my mom a lot more now.. keep at it.. keep calling out inequalities and unfairness.. loudly.. reformation will happen!
665,"I read this in one of the reddit comments about same topic.

Once the marriage was fixed, the guy started talking to would-be, they both connected and talked about their expectations.

At the same time, our bro started having talks and discussions with his parents about the girl's mindset. He sat the down and explained that she is from a different surrounding, and it is our duty to support her in adjusting to this household. He also told that she will not do household chores, and if the mother is burdened, they can get a maid if needed. Also told them that they aren't bringing a maid, so he urged them not to order her for small things like bringing water, etc. She also was working from home, so he set the expectations that she mustn't be disturbed, or asked for anything while she's working. 

On the other side, he sat the girl down and explained about his unorthodox parents. How they expect her to do some work at home, she should help them in certain chores, etc. Then when she actually came home, parents were happy, noticing her doing house works. They even stopped her from certain works. The girl also was happy to have in laws who would encourage her to work, not disturbing during her work hours. The mother would cook and do all chores while she worked, and when her work was over, she also contributed in the house works willingly.

The learning from the above is, how smart we act to unite each other. Nobody hates anybody, hatred is created in silent, forced adjustments. We all are good people, but our preconceived notions make us misunderstand someone who's very different from our cultural spectrum. Traditional parents dislike the so called modern women and vice versa. We forget that the main culprit is lack of knowledge or understanding. We have stopped understanding and started judging.

So, the best way is to make them understand the different points of view, so that we all can be different, yet similar. Because we all want one thing - happiness and stability in our home."
666,"How long are these visits to India?  

If a few weeks or so, post 3-4 days at yours, I would say, let your wife move to her parents (while you spend time at yours) & return a couple of days before your flight back.

Everybody will need to adjust for a limited time & and time spent individually will be more peaceful. 

The clash of generations & traditions is an age-old one & honestly has no straightforward resolution."
667,"This is not about you, your wife, your parents, her parents or anyone else involved in an individual capacity. It‚Äôs about the family life and it‚Äôs consequences.

You need to grow a bone you might have forgotten about - SPINE.

Use that to make your parents especially your mother understand the modern day dynamics of a family where both partners work and earn. Once your mother understands the workload your wife faces to provide both of you with a better life and that India trip is a time for her to relax too, she would be one of the first ones to stand for her daughter-in-law.

Then talk to your wife and explain her that certain compromises are to made to keep our older generation happy, but be sure that she is not the only one to make compromises. Nor should compromises be lopsided. If you are able to deal with these two things, visits to India would be much more pleasant.

P.S. It‚Äôs just not couples who live abroad face these issues, those who live with their families or where older generation shifts with the couple within India, face similar issues. If we can get thorough them, so can you."
668,You're problems are mild. If this is the only thing your mother and wife disagrees on consider it a boon and just talk to your mother and affirm this is just how we  are used to live and sounds fair to you. There are far worse difficult situations one can face in marriage.
669,"The only suggestion which comes to my mind for mental peace is TALK. Talk to your wife talk to your mother, both are close to you and if talked peaceful and in right way both will listen to you. Just try explaining. Talk on point do not go round and round. 

I think this will definitely help."
670,Western softies can not live in hardcore India ... live there with your privileges and security...... don't blame the Indian society for your spinelessness.
671,"I honestly do not see any reason as to why so many people are giving the OP a negative response and asking them to own up to ‚Äúyour family your problems‚Äù. Either people expect other people to absolutely perfect human beings with perfect communication skills and rationale, or are somehow okay with disrespecting others without knowing the entirety of their exact situation. It‚Äôd be better if we, as a community, actually helped out with the matter on which the advice is being sought, rather than passing our own judgements about what should the OP do and how they should behave. 

That being said, there‚Äôs some very good advice being offered in this comments section. I hope the OP is able to navigate through all the negativity and focus on the part that helps them grow and get out of this situation. All the best buddy, and take care. I hope you are able to solve this problem soon.

I also think that the OP should consider changing the title of the post to a rather more pragmatic one, as the automod has suggested."
672,"If you live and work in foreign country and visit India only during vactions, I think it must not be for more than 20-25 days per year. Also, if this time is divided 50-50, its not more than 10-12 days each year at your house.

Can't you find an amicable solution for just 10 days per year yourself instead of asking random internet strangers?!"
673,"You know I understand your situation completely as I am in the same boat. 
 its next to impossible for some men to flight against there parents to give equal treatments to their partner as well. I am also ashamed saying this but you will never stand for your wife so talk to her that it's only for few days and we need to adjust but please don't take bullshit from your mother against your wife. Your wife comes first. 
You will never help her in kitchen to do dishes or making meals in front of your mother but don't just sit and wait for your meal ,that will make your wife more angry get up and go in the kitchen try to ease her mood talk about random stuff and then try to help her in anyway ypu can. 
The more you show love and respect to your wife in front of your parenst the more she will go by plan to adjust for a while..
You men will never understand how little we women feel in your house. She is doing a huge favour for you never forget that."
674,"Honestly, all of the comments here are mostly, but in reality I think it needs to be a combination of all...

First of all, communicate with your partner, she's also going through a lot and let her know that you can see her agony as well, but also communicate that all of this is a toll on you as well...

Secondly, I assume you're happy abroad because you believe in sharing responsibilities and don't believe in gender roles... therefore, try to nudge and push your parents to also change... in the end you grew up in their household, so they might have done something right for you to have these progressive values...

Thirdly, your partner is part of this family as well, so she'll also need to give some time for things to change it's hard for things to change overnight.

Patience, and all the best!"
675,"Hi OP, i am sorry  you feel this way but i would want to know what's your opinion on this? i am sure you have one..

 If you are more inclined that your wife should adjust to tradition as you seldom visit to India (so I believe that can be manageable) then take a stand for that. 

If you are more inclined that traditional beliefs are in the past and support your wife thought process, then take a stand for that. 

It's affecting you cos you don't want to hurt any party.. But if you want to end a conflict, you have to choose a side and act accordingly."
676,It seems both your parents and wife are rigid af and lack maturity to handle this amicably hence it‚Äôs better off for you in your foreign country.
677,"I will be downvoted to hell for my opinion, but here it goes.

Ask your wife to adjust for a few days in an year while you are visiting India and staying at your home. You and your wife already live as you want to for most of the year. Just for the few days, just do as your mom wants. I would have a different opinion if you were staying with your parents all the time."
678,"Wow! How easy it is for people to call OP spineless as if he‚Äôs not the one sharing his ordeal!

Of course his wife is facing more of an issue but that doesn‚Äôt mean people start ignoring the mental agony OP is trying to share!

Mother and wife are two important women in a man‚Äôs life and it is never easy to handle issues between them. I am sure OP has tried but these women are coming with their reasonings and not understanding at all.

It is clear to me that just like his wife is ‚Äúdirect‚Äù, his mother is the same too! So, it‚Äôs absolutely not easy to sort things out between them for OP.

That being said, my advice is that if you are in India for a few days, you don‚Äôt need to escalate the matter any further, just past your time and go back to your foreign country.

Don‚Äôt expect or try to change either of the women since it‚Äôs just a matter of few days. Pass your time and go back to safe haven."
679,"Pffft! You do not want to live by the code of your parents so why do you even go on extended visits to their home? You want to live like they do in liberal west then you have to live like them: visiting parents as you visit any other acquaintances. That's it. Keep the visit short, stay in a hotel. Treat it like a vacation.

Too all those who are saying ""put your foot down"", stuff it! What right does he have in his parents home? What right does he have to tell them what he thinks is the right way? His parents have their expectation of lifestyle he should lead which he has no obligation to do so. by the same token, he has no power over his parents to tell them how the things should be in their home.

So, in your home, you live whatever way you want. In their home, you have to live by their rules. Simple as that. Kapish?"
680,"that thing ensuing between your wife and your mother is as old as our dear mother earth. no great philosopher has been able to solve it yet. so how come you expect yours will be different?
stop stressing yourself for this. let it happen whatever has to happen. don't think that this is happening because the two families are from different classes.
the mother in law and the wife can fight over anything . thats their birth right and they will for centuries to come.  no need to stop that."
681,"Wrong place to ask for advice, dude. Most people here are probably under 25 and without a spouse. I bet the most common response is going to be ‚Äò your wife should be the one complaining, not you!!‚Äô And the most common recommendation, ‚Äòtalk to your mother. She is the one that needs to change‚Äô

Honest opinion, both your mother and your wife have had their convictions built over a long time and they are not going to change easily or instantaneously. Forcing will only build bigger walls.

Work at it with both of them, more so with your mother( she is the one not in sync with the times anymore ). 

Note: if you have not passionately fought with your mother ( fights that resolve the next day) then you have not even started."
682,"I think you guys are well educated, so tell your wife at least to adjust a little bit, otherwise problems will remain the same. If you are worried about mental health then at least one of them should listen to your opinion. If your wife is friendly to you then tell her about your mental health she will find a solution for sure."
683,The problem that arises for me is total gastrointestinal destruction.
684,"I don't know why people are offended...on behalf of the OP's wife??!! 
Someone asked a question sharing their genuine concern and asked for help. Why are people hell bent on shaming that person.
Be nice, or don't say anything."

689,"Indian corporate scene sucks. Worse, if your clients are also Indians as they rather treat their vendors as slaves and have a lot of entitlement."
690,"Competition is definitely a thing. There's way too many people competing for way too less jobs. But it's also deeply woven in our work culture. I remember during my first job I was told that I should join my boss for a smoke break otherwise forget any career growth.

I have moved to Canada permanently now and compartively, things are way better. I haven't witnessed the same work culture here despite the huge number of Indians. Probably because it won't be acceptable over here."
691,"Indian corporates value action over progress. People want to assert their ego at every step to make it difficult for the other person, or they act cheap and overload teams to profit from the difference.

Very few companies realise that it is possible to produce more value through laser focused work in assigned hours rather than make people slog daily. 

In many other countries, you will be called out by HR if you are in office after hours daily. In India, you are more likely to be noticed as ‚Äúlacking initiative‚Äù in the appraisal if you strictly follow the working hours."
692,"I currently work for a EMEA startup, the only Indian in the team, hired specifically for the APAC region. Boss is American.

It took me more than 3 months to come out of the PTSD my previous startups gave me in the name of employment. Years and years of ptsd. Of course all my previous startups were Indian. I kept complaining to my wife that I feel like an imposter because I had ample time and little work to do. Never did over time and didn't even check Slack during weekend. But the team never had a problem with my performance and in fact encouraged me to take leaves, breaks etc. It took my hard working Indian ass more than 3 months to realize that this is what they call work-life balance.

My point is, there is a stark difference in how work-life balance is defined in different cultures. India, China, US...these countries believe in gadha mazdoori. Most of the work ends up being a result of upper management's inefficiency to manage talent, funds, ego and payroll. They hire less and extract more from you. Or hire more and ask you to justify your hiring. Indian MNCs especially lie about hourly billing to foreign clients and ask you din ka hisaab in the name of daily standup. Indian startups do randi rona of bad economy rather than evaluating the credibility of their senior management or product market fit. US clients, being the racist fucks they are, try to get the maximum out of 9 hour time zone difference.

Upon all this comes the chutiyapa of 5% hike, company is not profitable this year bullshit during appraisal cycle. And of course there is the good old glorification of hard work that is called hustling these days. Work hard, party harder. Here's your Friday pizza to absolve all the shit we gave you the entire week.  Pick my calls on weekend because I was too inefficient in managing my calendar and forgot to give you feedback. I'll give you feedback one week later but you give me that report by EOD. Why are you not online? Why are you not travelling two hours in traffic to reach office and work over time? You are qutting without an offer in hand? Jumping companies every year? Aren't you worried how your resume looks?

I can go on and on. To answer your question, yes, we have built a superficial work culture that pretends to be busy and self aware. But in reality it's 70% ego massage of upper management and 20% crisis management which resulted from their inflated credentials and ego. Rest 10% is work. Another 10% is the chutiyapa that gets added because we are Indian and we have a fetish for gadha mazdoori. Total hua 110% because that's what you promised you'd do in your interview."
693,"Very few companies in the Indian IT/Consultancy scene truly understand the meaning of work-life balance. You'll get tons of annoying emails from HR with bullshit infographics telling you how it is important to ""take a step back"" and ""go on a vacation"". You'll also get tons of emails where managers are giving spot awards to subordinates for being workaholic. Then you'll get emails from HR about company offering ""confidential"" therapy sessions to your overworked ass.  


The entire thing is one big meme really."
694,"Almost everything in India seems to be inefficient. I often go to HDFC bank, that too a big branch in a metro. There are around 20 people or so as staff. But only one or two counters for cash transactions. Often only one counter is manned even when there are many people waiting in the queue. That person takes around 10 minutes to serve a customer even for simple things like depositing money. I have never seen such inefficient service anywhere else in the world."
695,"It's just another way to weed out the weak ones.  The late emails are just to trigger anxiety and sleep loss.  

The sleep deprivation then leads to early heart attacks, road accidents,  mental breakdown due to divorce etc.  They can't compete so well if they are handling a messy divorce or missing a limb. Or in jail due to road rage. 

So another opening opens up at the company,  everybody gets a joining bonus and things start again. 

Yes the above is sarcasm."
696,"Its more like people working extra hours and then expecting others to do same.
Same individuals during actual work hours end up doing extremely less amount of work and then post normal work hours suddenly gets charged up
Not that they end up doing extra work.
They would have seen same from their seniors and that way whole company culture becomes inefficient and that inefficiency gets seen as dedication and hard work."
697,"The laws are weak and a majority of the workforce is underpaid. 
As there is no way for you to claim overtime without burning bridges, all you‚Äôre left with is the hope of climbing up the ladder to get better pay. 
This paired with the unlimited supply of people willing to do what you do at half the pay, forces people to be the best. Now comes the MNC with their American culture, it‚Äôs not so much Indian but the corporate culture of America that rewards and promotes unhealthy obsession with work. 
Americans are known to not take vacations and feel pride in the fact that they put in extra hours at work, when such culture reaches India, the extremely high competition, unethical managers and no respect for time leads to what you see today.
There is change brewing, I know people from my generation and the next one are already drawing boundaries. We‚Äôll be better off but I‚Äôll take some time."
698,"Yup, one of the benefits of having 2 billion people in the country is that if you don‚Äôt want to work beyond 8 pm, there are a million others standing in line behind you who will. Having a personal life is considered stealing from the company. In my first job, on the first day, my manager told me ‚Äúyou have to work till midnight everyday because you are a bachelor and don‚Äôt have anything to do after going home.‚Äù That mentality hasn‚Äôt changed ever. And yes, we are extremely inefficient. People come to office at 10 am but only start working around 3 pm, and then stay till midnight to accomplish 2 hours of work. It‚Äôs genetic, nothing can be done."
699,I feel Indian work culture is work harder not smarter.
700,"One of the reasons for late emails (anecdotal evidence) : All my friends and even me when I was working used to send late emails because we started working late after dinner. They simply don't wake up at 7 and start working at 9. 


Usual routine is : Check if anything urgent comes up at 9-10. Then chill, breakfast, gym, and hang out with the family. Starts at 12 or 1 then lunch. They work till 5 or max 6. 

Then enjoy life till dinner. Then work at night

All of them work in less than 8 hours. 

I have had European and American counterparts and they were lazy, inefficient and just like to claim to do work rather than actual work. Americans tend to be better than Europeans but Chinese and Indians are the ones who work more fast and precise. 

Again, its anecdotal experience like yours"
701,"This is what the world wants, your skills determine the hours you put in. All of Asia puts in big hours."
702,"I think you also need to understand that lots of European companies are decades to century old. They have honed their manufacturing potential through the labor of workers for decades. India just doesn't have it. If we need to have products with a percentage of quality of western products, we need to work more. 

Essentially there is a huge gap which Indian companies need to fill"

It must be such a tricky situation as an Indian kid because we have such a selfless ,dedicated an image of our mothers that watching them doing something good for themselves especially with their love life which doesn‚Äôt involve us seems selfish but it completely fine and a good thing for her own mental health.

Would you prefer her completely broken and resenting your dad,bringing old memories for the rest of her life or happily moving on with someone else? 
You have to do lot of selfwork here to accommodate in your new family dynamics which no one one reddit can help you with, may be honest with her about your feelings. All the best:)"
709,"Hi OP,

This hits home. Few years ago, a friend of mine was in a similar situation. Her mother & father drifted apart even though they lovingly married each other and had two kids and got involved with her coworker 

Maybe stop looking at the situation from your point of view of a son but rather a man /friend. While doing that, please tell your mother your point in a nice manner
She might have a negative reaction, you'll have to reassure her that you are not against the relationship but the awkwardness it is giving you.

All the best!"
710,"The controlling and abusive behaviour is a HUGE RED FLAG. 

If he is manipulating now on all these things, it's obvious that he'll start manipulating when things start going south. He might even blackmail by threatening to tell things to your father.

Have seen such a case myself and thus being a devil's advocate.

It can be pretty bad"
711,"So let's get a clear answer from you, what do you wish for your mother?

1. She goes back to an abusive relationship and man
2. She spends her life alone occasionally meeting her friends 
3. She find happiness with someone who isn't an abuser

You are literally acting like a man-child here. Grow up and rejoice in the fact that perhaps your mother has found happiness.

If it makes you so uncomfortable, tell your mother she should apply to get divorced and then pursue her new man."
712,"Im having trouble sympathizing with OP‚Äôs mom. Morally, this is wrong. Period. She is still married. Were the parents separated it could have been a grey area but she is still married and mostly living with OP‚Äôs father. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for OP to condone mother‚Äôs affair, emotional or physical. 

I feel for the OP. I feel like the OP is caught between a rock and stick. Maybe the mother is the only parent OP has a good relationship with and hence OP feels the need to accept this. I am a little concerned how the family dynamics which is now weird is going to affect the OP and if the dad or relatives found out, it will only further erode already delicate family dynamics. 

Further, if the dad finds out OP knew, he will consider it a betrayal. There could be major consequences. 

I have had my share of physical abuse and verbal abuse from my own dad. My mom has never been happy with him. She has suffered all her life. She isn‚Äôt even thinking of another guy and if she was hanging out with another dude, I would not support that. This is crazy

OP‚Äôs mother could have a stern talk with the dad. Draw a line what is allowed and not allowed anymore. There are plenty of ways to go about this than do something morally wrong. Sneaking around husband‚Äôs back with another guy. This is not the way !!! 

What kind of role model is OP‚Äôs mother going to be ? She is teaching that if you‚Äôre not happy in the marriage, don‚Äôt leave but stay and have your share of fun ? 

She could separate from the dad first before all this. She could divorce. I‚Äôm not saying she has to give up on this ‚Äòother‚Äô guy but there is a right way to go about this."

On a serious note these deadlines suck. I am a article on big4 assurance. While I am lucky enough to have a manageable client right now but there are still times where I have started calls with senior around mid nights, expecting one tonight as well. 

My peers in other mid size firms are in their offices for close to 13-14 hours daily during this time with no weekends.

758,"Been in a Big 4 for 6 years now. Even here it depends department to department and team to team. Within the same department there might be a team where people keep slogging off cause the manager can't plan the work very well and there can also be a team where everything is chill cause manager can manage well.

Even within the team which geenrally keeps slogging off, you could have a person who doesn't slog a lot cause they're extremely quick and efficient at their work + have a good understanding with their senior.

One thing I've noticed that makes lives easier, performances better and slogging lesser is that one needs to understand what's the work that senior wants and expects. Half of the time people end up working late because they do something and when the senior reviews it, its not the way they wanted it so there's rework required.

Now there could also be instances where there can actually be a shit ton of work and it's gonna take you long hours to get it done. But atleast in Big 4s one can get additional support from other team members who don't have a lot of work and have some extra bandwidth. Then in that case it again comes down to the point I mentioned earlier.

Summimg it up one can't give a blanket statement whether a life at a Big 4 is extremely stressful or extremely chilled. It depends on a lot of factors, the biggest one being you. If you enjoy your work and believe that whatever you're doing is actually adding value to the project, no matter how many long hours you put in its always gonna feel worth it. If you're not happy with your work even working for 5 hours a day might not make you happy."
759,"Is there any data, how many ex-muslims are currently there in India?

I see YouTube videos getting views but I think most of the views are from Muslims trying to counter you or other religions supporting."

763,"First of all, let me clarify, I'm an agnostic and I fkin hate these Ex-(xyz religion) guys. And why am I segregating those when it seems like they means the same? They don't.

What I've observed that the people who call them Ex-xyz, instead of an atheist or agnostic are a different kind of religious fanatics. You must think an Ex-xyz religion guy would just denounce their religion and go their own way and try to get away from religion but no, all they have to do is to shit on religion, find flaws in them, make fun of it, rile and ridicule believers and at the same time make a villain out of agnostics/atheists like us who just want to denounce their religion and mind their own business. Thanks to them, the believers think that every non believer thinks like these idiots and is influenced by them.

Most of these fks are just attention whores with low self esteem who think they're doing something revolutionary just because they somehow manage to get a crowd thanks to religious bell ends who love to see people making fun of the opposite religion. While in reality it is just a medium to vent their other frustrations in life, with religion being the punching bag.


I mean if you want to denounce religion, you try to get as further away from it as possible. But these guys actually are more into religion than casual believers, they fking recite lines from religious books, do hour long discusssions on religion, try to spend their whole time to learn more about a religion only to find flaws and shit on them.

Religion sure has its flaws, but if you really think that this is the way to make people aware, you're just making life harder for atheists/agnostics who just want to denounce their religion because they don't want to live by a book, or stars or whatever, and just want to do what's logical and think objectiveky, which is the reason why majority of agnostics/atheists become one."

The Indian Exmuslim community barely exists, there are a few regional groups but they don't really talk to one another.

You can find Indian exmuslims in atheist groups or the more socially accepted term - rationalist societies but they are not as active as they ought to be and even rationalists have been forced into exile or murdered.

783,"You are in Bombay, which has ample opportunities. But small towns and villages have a large number of youngsters preparing for govt jobs."
784,It‚Äôs because no one wants to waste away their 20s preparing for a statistically insignificant chance at passing.
785,it varies with regions. Bihar is a good example.
786,"No, the craze continues, but there are not many government jobs. Government is doing the trick of converting jobs into contract positions with low pay, no benefits, and whimsical management. 

Even jobs that they have conducted exams for and put up results, sent letters etc are delaying joining. The latest example being the recruitment in the railways. So many people were asked to quit their existing jobs and now they have been waiting for years.

All of this works for ModiG20 to get his press photos distributing employment letters etc, but it's empty promises."
787,One look at the number of applications might tell you otherwise
788,UPSC CSE is no longer reliable as a career option. Other exams the vacancies have been decreasing. Why waste your 20s hankering over unreliable career options.
789,"Your friend group is way too small a sample for you to form an opinion about the craze of government jobs in the whole country.

The coaching business for government job preparations is at an all-time high, that happens because there's demand for it. Depends on regions as well, in some states people are less enthusiastic for government jobs while in other state people will kill for it."
790,"It's still a big thing in places where there aren't much opportunities like bihar, bengal"
791,"The craze continues but has been mellowed down because of:

1. limited hiring by government organization

2. Whatever hiring is there, at least 50% of that is going to be taken up by the privileged ""castes""

3. Even if you end up getting hired, there's reservations is promotions as well. You will see those with far lesser ability and experience overtake you. You will have to end up reporting to them.

Source: I had a govt job, left it for the private sector."
792,"Since you are in mumbai you may not come across such people, but majority of our population still runs after govt jobs incessantly for years."
793,"whats there left for govt job? 

there is no pension. The one major benefit of govt job was ,even if your pay is low as compared to your peers in private sector, you and your family were assured of a pension after retirement. 

NPS performance is going down over the years and its even worse as compared to EPF, as you can't withdraw any amount till you hit 60 years and then also you can only do partial withdrawal. 

govt is looking for privatisation into multiple sectors.

no pay revision is done since last 8 years and there will be none for next 2-3 years and more ,if the govt has its way.

Private sector is paying much much more than govt sector.

CGHS is horrible and a lot of govt employees are being forced to take private insurance.

so what else is left? Unless you are really really really self motivated for ""service to the nation"" or all you want to do is corruption, why would a highly educated person leave much much better earning opportunity in private sector ?"
794,In academia it is still one of the most sought after positions. Thanks to how privatised higher education  is temperamental and yields to state pressures.
795,"It is decreasing among educated folks among metro cities where there are now much better opportunities.

Most government jobs have 1-2% probability of selection, and even if you miraculously get selected you‚Äôll get a paltry salary and unlike before there‚Äôs no pension (except NPS, but that‚Äôs available for corporate too).

People who are smart enough to be part of top 1% of the country would either emigrate or get a top tier job in India which pays 5-10x what a government job does, with faster growth.

Unless you‚Äôve decided that you‚Äôre gonna take the risk of being a corrupt officer or you‚Äôre a big deshbhakt government jobs have nothing to offer."
796,Tbh the craze for government jobs is on an all time high in tier 2 cities.
797,It‚Äôs only in places like UP/Bihar - where there is no industry or law and order or both
798,"Nah bro. People in Mumbai start working from the age of 18-21. They need to earn for themselves to survive here as family income is not enough in the city.

803,"Govt is not taking responsibility to create jobs they pushed that on startups and other units 

These gave private entities to exploit employees with benefits since govt is very linear with the regulation s and scrutiny

Statistically it's better to get hired by an MNC than a govt entity with limited seats and high number of applications and minimal pay as well as sub par benefits

Also taking bribe is also harder as on social media and hyperconnected internet

Also even u work hard chances are 70% some reservations family will take it below ur belt"
804,"No. Never. Nothing will give you so much money , security, and lifetime pension for so little work as a govt job. And the bribes can be a huge income as well."

1. The fact you are having a girlfriend is an achievement. Most of us do not. I got married only due to arrange marriage and my wife reminds me that time to time that I am short, really dark skinned and stupid. Count yourself lucky!
2. Know this, if you can get a girlfriend right now, you will be able to get another one 3 years time. Meaning, if they have to go, then let it be. You are her boyfriend on your own merit and you will get another girl on your own merit. Keep your head high, your body healthy and remember, the newer model comes every darn day.
3. Did you two go on to the third base and home run on her or not? If not, do it now! Remember to use protection but do it now. It is a massive mood booster and increases intimacy and confidence in both the partners. Its God gift to the man kind. Use it well and responsibly! Do it frequently if she agrees.
4. You are a darned lawyer, you need to develop thick skin my man. Things will always be shit around you (not in financial terms but anyways) because your profession involves defeating others. Its going to be zero sum game. Get used to it. Remember, it will always cut but it only hurts this bad the first time.
5. You brother's wife is your brother's wife not yours. There are ways to mitigate 498A you know that, right? It has been a thorn in everyone's eyes. Thankfully you are in MP. Every darned thing about MP is rather corrupt. I am from Morena as well, so I know. Use it for your advantage. There are ways to delay dilute and destroy cases. You know that right? In the long term, get rid of her. Ask your brother to get a divorce. She is a hazard for your and your father's health. Just remove her from the family by divorce. Send her to her fathers home for few months and serve a a divorce notice.
6. The stupid government job will come when its ready. Meanwhile join a law firm or sit with an established lawyer. May be your senior from college. Try get some money by handling basic cases like getting bails in magistrate court or something simple. Learn the ropes of the profession you started out to be in. Make some money. Take your girlfriend out often and have sex with her often. It keeps things moving."

816,"I'm at Step 1: Get a gf üôè

But in my previous relationship we used to have a mutual understanding. We didn't keep track of our expenses exclusively. Didn't bother us really since we didn't spent much on things apart from food. It worked out for us.
Splitwise sounds good though."
817,It‚Äôs a sign of healthy adult relationship. Don‚Äôt go by patriarchal stereotypes.

Some people just split on the spot, some will use splitwise etc to square up every month/week and some couples just have an understanding wherein they split up what expense each person pays for.

819,"Meh we kinda just go back and forth. She'll pay sometimes and I'll pay sometimes. There's just too much to constantly keep logging and neither of us like to spend much time on our phones. If I'm going over to hers and she asks me to buy vegetables I'll buy some. If shes coming over to mine and i ask her to buy detergent she'll buy some.

In the end it usually evens out, so why bother sitting and charging each other for every potato and beer we buy?"
820,"She pays sometimes, I pay other times. If we go on 2-3 day vacay ( mostly we are long distance coz of jobs) , I do most booking stuff but then she pays incidentals like food etc and offers to split even hotel bookings on her own."
